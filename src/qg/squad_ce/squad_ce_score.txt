S-1444	following the parallel ##og ##ram rule of vector addition such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities : they have magnitude and direction . when two forces act on a point particle , the resulting force , the resultant ( also called the net force ) , can be determined by following the parallel ##og ##ram rule of vector addition : the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallel ##og ##ram , gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the trans ##vers ##al of the parallel ##og ##ram . the magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitude ##s of the two forces to their sum , depending on the angle between their lines of action .
