her appearance [SEP] in august , the couple attended the 2011 mtv video music awards , at which beyonce performed " love on top " and started the performance saying " tonight i want you to stand up on your feet , i want you to feel the love that ' s growing inside of me " . at the end of the performance , she dropped her microphone , un ##bu ##tton ##ed her blaze ##r and rubbed her stomach , confirming her pregnancy she had all ##uded to earlier in the evening . her appearance helped that year ' s mtv video music awards become the most - watched broadcast in mtv history , pulling in 12 . 4 million viewers ; the announcement was listed in guinness world records for " most t ##wee ##ts per second recorded for a single event " on twitter , receiving 8 , 86 ##8 t ##wee ##ts per second and " beyonce pregnant " was the most google ##d term the week of august 29 , 2011 .
her vocal abilities [SEP] beyonce ' s vocal range spans four octave ##s . jody rosen highlights her tone and tim ##bre as particularly distinctive , describing her voice as " one of the most compelling instruments in popular music " . while another critic says she is a " vocal ac ##ro ##bat , being able to sing long and complex mel ##ism ##as and vocal runs effortlessly , and in key . her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the center ##piece of destiny ' s child . the daily mail calls beyonce ' s voice " versatile " , capable of exploring power ballads , soul , rock belt ##ing , operatic flourish ##es , and hip hop . jon par ##eles of the new york times commented that her voice is " velvet ##y yet tar ##t , with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belt ##ing " . rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced beyonce ' s strange rhythmic vocal style , but also finds her quite traditional ##ist in her use of ballad ##ry , gospel and false ##tto . other critics praise her range and power , with chris richards of the washington post saying she was " capable of pun ##ct ##uating any beat with goose - bump - inducing whispers or full - bore diva - roar ##s . "
accustomed to the piano - bash ##ing of local artists [SEP] back in warsaw that year , chopin heard niccolo pagan ##ini play the violin , and composed a set of variations , so ##uven ##ir de pagan ##ini . it may have been this experience which encouraged him to commence writing his first etudes , ( 1829 – 32 ) , exploring the capacities of his own instrument . on 11 august , three weeks after completing his studies at the warsaw conservatory , he made his debut in vienna . he gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews — in addition to some commenting ( in chopin ' s own words ) that he was " too delicate for those accustomed to the piano - bash ##ing of local artists " . in one of these concerts , he premiered his variations on la ci dare ##m la man ##o , op . 2 ( variations on an aria from mozart ' s opera don giovanni ) for piano and orchestra . he returned to warsaw in september 1829 , where he premiered his piano concerto no . 2 in f minor , op . 21 on 17 march 1830 .
fear of being buried alive [SEP] some of his friends provided music at his request ; among them , pot ##ock ##a sang and fran ##cho ##mme played the cello . chopin requested that his body be opened after death ( for fear of being buried alive ) and his heart returned to warsaw where it rests at the church of the holy cross . he also bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method , pro ##jet de method ##e , to al ##kan for completion . on 17 october , after midnight , the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly . " no longer " , he replied . he died a few minutes before two o ' clock in the morning . those present at the death ##bed appear to have included his sister lu ##d ##wi ##ka , princess marcel ##ina c ##zar ##tory ##ska , sand ' s daughter sol ##ange , and his close friend thomas albrecht . later that morning , sol ##ange ' s husband cl ##es ##inger made chopin ' s death mask and a cast of his left hand .

the failure of the november 1830 [SEP] with his ma ##zu ##rka ##s and polo ##nais ##es , chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of nationalism . schumann , in his 1836 review of the piano concerto ##s , highlighted the composer ' s strong feelings for his native poland , writing that " now that the poles are in deep mourning [ after the failure of the november 1830 rising ] , their appeal to us artists is even stronger . . . if the mighty auto ##crat in the north [ i . e . nicholas i of russia ] could know that in chopin ' s works , in the simple strains of his ma ##zu ##rka ##s , there lu ##rks a dangerous enemy , he would place a ban on his music . chopin ' s works are cannon buried in flowers ! " the biography of chopin published in 1863 under the name of franz liszt ( but probably written by carolyn ##e zu say ##n - wit ##t ##gens ##tein ) claims that chopin " must be ranked first among the first musicians . . . individual ##izing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation . "
the allegiance of various tibetan princes [SEP] shi ##h - shan henry ts ##ai writes that the yong ##le emperor sent his eun ##uch yang san ##ba ##o into tibet in 141 ##3 to gain the allegiance of various tibetan princes , while the yong ##le emperor paid a small fortune in return gifts for tribute ##s in order to maintain the loyalty of neighboring vassal states such as nepal and tibet . however , van pr ##aa ##g states that tibetan rulers upheld their own separate relations with the kingdoms of nepal and kashmir , and at times " engaged in armed confrontation with them . "

"
to seek out the karma ##pa [SEP] in order to seek out the karma ##pa , the yong ##le emperor dispatched his eun ##uch ho ##u xi ##an and the buddhist monk z ##hi gu ##ang ( d . 143 ##5 ) to tibet . traveling to l ##has ##a either through qing ##hai or via the silk road to k ##hot ##an , ho ##u xi ##an and z ##hi gu ##ang did not return to nanjing until 140 ##7 .
to forcibly give the karma ##pa authority over all the tibetan buddhist schools [SEP] tibetan sources say des ##hin she ##k ##pa also persuaded the yong ##le emperor not to impose his military might on tibet as the mongols had previously done . thin ##ley writes that before the karma ##pa returned to tibet , the yong ##le emperor began planning to send a military force into tibet to forcibly give the karma ##pa authority over all the tibetan buddhist schools but des ##hin she ##k ##pa di ##ss ##ua ##ded him . however , ho ##k - lam chan states that " there is little evidence that this was ever the emperor ' s intention " and that evidence indicates that des ##hin sk ##ek ##pa was invited strictly for religious purposes .
to facilitate trade with tibet [SEP] ts ##ai writes that shortly after the visit by des ##hin she ##k ##pa , the yong ##le emperor ordered the construction of a road and of trading posts in the upper reaches of the yang ##zi and me ##kong rivers in order to facilitate trade with tibet in tea , horses , and salt . the trade route passed through sichuan and crossed shang ##ri - la county in yunnan . wang and ny ##ima assert that this " tribute - related trade " of the ming exchanging chinese tea for tibetan horses — while granting tibetan envoy ##s and tibetan merchants explicit permission to trade with han chinese merchants — " further ##ed the rule of the ming dynasty court over tibet " . ross ##abi and sp ##er ##ling note that this trade in tibetan horses for chinese tea existed long before the ming . peter c . per ##due says that wang an ##shi ( 102 ##1 – 1086 ) , realizing that china could not produce enough mil ##ita ##rily capable ste ##ed ##s , had also aimed to obtain horses from inner asia in exchange for chinese tea . the chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army ' s supply wagons . the tibetan ##s required chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement . the ming government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to regulate this trade with state - supervised markets , but these collapsed in 144 ##9 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial pressures on the tea - producing regions .
to secure urgently needed horses [SEP] van pr ##aa ##g states that the ming court established diplomatic delegation ##s with tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses . wang and ny ##ima argue that these were not diplomatic delegation ##s at all , that tibetan areas were ruled by the ming since tibetan leaders were granted positions as ming officials , that horses were collected from tibet as a mandatory " co ##r ##ve ##e " tax , and therefore tibetan ##s were " undertaking domestic affairs , not foreign diplomacy " . sp ##er ##ling writes that the ming simultaneously bought horses in the k ##ham region while fighting tibetan tribes in am ##do and receiving tibetan em ##bas ##sies in nanjing . he also argues that the em ##bas ##sies of tibetan lama ##s visiting the ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lama ##s ' large , wealthy entourage and ming chinese merchants and officials . ko ##lma ##s writes that while the ming maintained a lai ##sse ##z - fair ##e policy towards tibet and limited the numbers of the tibetan re ##tin ##ues , the tibetan ##s sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the ming because imperial patronage provided them with wealth and power . laird writes that tibetan ##s eagerly sought ming court invitations since the gifts the tibetan ##s received for bringing tribute were much greater in value than the latter . as for the yong ##le emperor ' s gifts to his tibetan and nepal ##ese vassal ##s such as silver ware ##s , buddha relics , ut ##ens ##ils for buddhist temples and religious ceremonies , and gown ##s and robes for monks , ts ##ai writes " in his effort to draw neighboring states to the ming orbit so that he could bas ##k in glory , the yong ##le emperor was quite willing to pay a small price " . the information office of the state council of the prc lists the tibetan tribute items as ox ##en , horses , camel ##s , sheep , fur products , medical herbs , tibetan incense ##s , than ##g ##kas ( painted scrolls ) , and hand ##ic ##raf ##ts ; while the ming awarded tibetan tribute - bearer ##s an equal value of gold , silver , satin and bro ##cade , bolts of cloth , grains , and tea leaves . silk workshops during the ming also cater ##ed specifically to the tibetan market with silk clothes and furnishings featuring tibetan buddhist icon ##ography .
to help stabilize border regions and protect trade routes [SEP] discussions of strategy in the mid ming dynasty focused primarily on recovery of the or ##dos region , which the mongols used as a rally ##ing base to stage raids into ming china . nor ##bu states that the ming dynasty , preoccupied with the mongol threat to the north , could not spare additional armed forces to enforce or back up their claim of sovereignty over tibet ; instead , they relied on " con ##fu ##cian instruments of tribute relations " of heap ##ing unlimited number of titles and gifts on tibetan lama ##s through acts of diplomacy . sp ##er ##ling states that the delicate relationship between the ming and tibet was " the last time a united china had to deal with an independent tibet , " that there was a potential for armed conflict at their borders , and that the ultimate goal of ming foreign policy with tibet was not sub ##ju ##gation but " avoidance of any kind of tibetan threat . " p . christi ##aan k ##lie ##ger argues that the ming court ' s patronage of high tibetan lama ##s " was designed to help stabilize border regions and protect trade routes . "
committed to their religious leader [SEP] laird writes that alta ##n khan abolished the native mongol practices of shaman ##ism and blood sacrifice , while the mongol princes and subjects were coe ##rce ##d by alta ##n to convert to gel ##ug buddhism — or face execution if they persisted in their shaman ##istic ways . committed to their religious leader , mongol princes began requesting the dalai lama to best ##ow titles on them , which demonstrated " the unique fusion of religious and political power " wi ##eld ##ed by the dalai lama , as laird writes . ko ##lma ##s states that the spiritual and secular mongol - tibetan alliance of the 13th century was renewed by this alliance constructed by alta ##n khan and son ##am g ##yat ##so . van pr ##aa ##g writes that this restored the original mongol patronage of a tibetan lama and " to this day , mongolian ##s are among the most devout followers of the gel ##ug ##pa and the dalai lama . " angela f . howard writes that this unique relationship not only provided the dalai lama and pan ##chen lama with religious and political authority in tibet , but that alta ##n khan gained " enormous power among the entire mongol population . "
firm ##ness of the terrain [SEP] japanese se ##ism ##ologist yu ##ji ya ##gi at the university of ts ##uk ##uba said that the earthquake occurred in two stages : " the 155 - mile long ##men ##shan fault tore in two sections , the first one ripping about seven yards , followed by a second one that shear ##ed four yards . " his data also showed that the earthquake lasted about two minutes and released 30 times the energy of the great hans ##hin earthquake of 1995 in japan , which killed over 6 , 000 people . he pointed out that the shallow ##ness of the epic ##enter and the density of population greatly increased the severity of the earthquake . ter ##uy ##uki kato , a se ##ism ##ologist at the university of tokyo , said that the seismic waves of the quake traveled a long distance without losing their power because of the firm ##ness of the terrain in central china . according to reports from cheng ##du , the capital of sichuan province , the earthquake tremor ##s lasted for " about two or three minutes " .
because it was caused by a different fault . [SEP] ( the ms 6 . 1 earthquake on august 30 , 2008 in southern sichuan was not part of this series because it was caused by a different fault . see 2008 pan ##zhi ##hua earthquake for details . )
evacuated [SEP] office buildings in shanghai ' s financial district , including the jin mao tower and the hong kong new world tower , were evacuated . a receptionist at the tibet hotel in cheng ##du said things were " calm " after the hotel evacuated its guests . meanwhile , workers at a ford plant in sichuan were evacuated for about 10 minutes . cheng ##du shu ##ang ##li ##u international airport was shut down , and the control tower and regional radar control evacuated . one silk ##air flight was diverted and landed in kun ##ming as a result . cat ##hay pacific delayed both legs of its quad ##rup ##le daily hong kong to london route due to this disruption in air traffic services . cheng ##du shu ##ang ##li ##u airport reopened later on the evening of may 12 , offering limited service as the airport began to be used as a staging area for relief operations .
disruption in air traffic services [SEP] office buildings in shanghai ' s financial district , including the jin mao tower and the hong kong new world tower , were evacuated . a receptionist at the tibet hotel in cheng ##du said things were " calm " after the hotel evacuated its guests . meanwhile , workers at a ford plant in sichuan were evacuated for about 10 minutes . cheng ##du shu ##ang ##li ##u international airport was shut down , and the control tower and regional radar control evacuated . one silk ##air flight was diverted and landed in kun ##ming as a result . cat ##hay pacific delayed both legs of its quad ##rup ##le daily hong kong to london route due to this disruption in air traffic services . cheng ##du shu ##ang ##li ##u airport reopened later on the evening of may 12 , offering limited service as the airport began to be used as a staging area for relief operations .
caught on fire [SEP] reporters in cheng ##du said they saw cracks on walls of some residential buildings in the downtown areas , but no buildings collapsed . many beijing office towers were evacuated , including the building housing the media offices for the organizers of the 2008 summer olympics . none of the olympic venues were damaged . meanwhile , a cargo train carrying 13 petrol tanks der ##ailed in hui county , gan ##su , and caught on fire after the rail was distorted .

sho ##ddy construction [SEP] in terms of school casualties , thousands of school children died due to sho ##ddy construction . in mia ##nya ##ng city , seven schools collapsed , burying at least 1 , 700 people . at least 7 , 000 school buildings throughout the province collapsed . another 700 students were buried in a school in han ##wang . at least 600 students and staff died at ju ##yuan elementary school . up to 1 , 300 children and teachers died at bei ##chua ##n middle school .
an international reconnaissance team of engineers was dispatched to the region [SEP] in the days following the disaster , an international reconnaissance team of engineers was dispatched to the region to make a detailed preliminary survey of damaged buildings . their findings show a variety of reasons why many constructions failed to withstand the earthquake .
donated blood [SEP] following the earthquake , donations were made by people from all over mainland china , with booths set up in schools , at banks , and around gas stations . people also donated blood , resulting in according to xi ##nh ##ua long line - ups in most major chinese cities . many donated through text messaging on mobile phones to accounts set up by china un ##ico ##m and china mobile by may 16 , the chinese government had allocated a total of $ 77 ##2 million for earthquake relief so far , up sharply from $ 159 million from may 14 .
inadequate ##ly engineered [SEP] the central government estimates that over 7 , 000 inadequate ##ly engineered school ##rooms collapsed in the earthquake . chinese citizens have since invented a catch phrase : " to ##fu - dr ##eg ##s schoolhouse ##s " ( chinese : [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) , to mock both the quality and the quantity of these inferior constructions that killed so many school children . due to the one - child policy , many families lost their only child when schools in the region collapsed during the earthquake . consequently , sichuan provincial and local officials have lifted the restriction for families whose only child was either killed or severely injured in the disaster . so - called " illegal children " under 18 years of age may be registered as legal replacements for their dead siblings ; if the dead child was illegal , no further outstanding fines would apply . rei ##mb ##urse ##ment would not , however , be offered for fines that were already levi ##ed .
to gain first - hand material of construction quality [SEP] however , reuters reported in june that , to date , chinese prosecutors have joined an official inquiry into ten collapsed schools during may ' s devastating earthquake to gain first - hand material of construction quality at the collapsed schools , launch preliminary inquiries and prepare for possible investigations into professional crime . it was also reported that safety checks were to be carried out at schools across china after last month ' s earthquake .
crime of inc ##iting sub ##version [SEP] besides parents , liu sha ##oku ##n ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) , a sichuan school teacher , was detained on june 25 , 2008 for " di ##sse ##minating rumors and destroying social order " about the sichuan earthquake . liu ’ s family was later told that he was being investigated on suspicion of the crime of inc ##iting sub ##version . liu had travelled to the shi ##fan ##g , taken photos of collapsed school buildings , and put them online . he had also expressed his anger at “ the sho ##ddy to ##fu - dr ##eg ##s buildings ” ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) in a media interview . he was ordered to serve one year of re - education through labor ( rt ##l ) . according to the organization human rights in china , liu has been released to serve his rt ##l sentence outside of the labor camp .
magnitude of the quake [SEP] because of the magnitude of the quake , and the media attention on china , foreign nations and organizations immediately responded to the disaster by offering condo ##lence ##s and assistance . on may 14 , unicef reported that china formally requested the support of the international community to respond to the needs of affected families .
builders cut corners [SEP] on may 15 , 2008 geoff ##ery york of the globe ##and ##mail . com reported that the sho ##dd ##ily constructed buildings are commonly called " to ##fu buildings " because builders cut corners by replacing steel rods with thin iron wires for concrete re - info ##rce ##ment ; using inferior grade cement , if any at all ; and using fewer bricks than they should . one local was quoted in the article as saying that " the supervising agencies did not check to see if it met the national standards . "
shot and killed [SEP] attic ##us does not want jem and scout to be present at tom robinson ' s trial . no seat is available on the main floor , so by invitation of rev . sykes , jem , scout , and dil ##l watch from the colored balcony . attic ##us establishes that the accuse ##rs — may ##ella and her father , bob e ##well , the town drunk — are lying . it also becomes clear that the friend ##less may ##ella made sexual advances toward tom , and that her father caught her and beat her . despite significant evidence of tom ' s innocence , the jury convicts him . jem ' s faith in justice becomes badly shaken , as is attic ##us ' , when the ha ##ples ##s tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison .
to opt ##imi ##ze the productivity of plants [SEP] agriculture and ho ##rti ##culture seek to opt ##imi ##ze the capture of solar energy in order to opt ##imi ##ze the productivity of plants . techniques such as timed planting cycles , tailored row orientation , staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields . while sunlight is generally considered a pl ##ent ##iful resource , the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture . during the short growing seasons of the little ice age , french and english farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy . these walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripe ##ning by keeping plants warm . early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south , but over time , sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight . in 1699 , nicolas fat ##io de du ##ill ##ier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pi ##vot to follow the sun . applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water , drying crops , brooding chicks and drying chicken man ##ure . more recently the technology has been embraced by vin ##ters , who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses .
they are low - cost , have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems [SEP] phase change materials such as para ##ffin wax and g ##lau ##ber ' s salt are another thermal storage media . these materials are inexpensive , readily available , and can deliver domestically useful temperatures ( approximately 64 °c or 147 °f ) . the " dover house " ( in dover , massachusetts ) was the first to use a g ##lau ##ber ' s salt heating system , in 1948 . solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using molten salts . salts are an effective storage medium because they are low - cost , have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems . the solar two used this method of energy storage , allowing it to store 1 . 44 ter ##aj ##ou ##les ( 400 , 000 kw ##h ) in its 68 cubic metres storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99 % .
most standard meters accurately measure in both directions [SEP] off - grid pv systems have traditionally used rec ##har ##ge ##able batteries to store excess electricity . with grid - tied systems , excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid , while standard grid electricity can be used to meet short ##falls . net meter ##ing programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid . this is handled by ' rolling back ' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consume ##s . if the net electricity use is below zero , the utility then rolls over the ki ##low ##att hour credit to the next month . other approaches involve the use of two meters , to measure electricity consumed vs . electricity produced . this is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter . most standard meters accurately measure in both directions , making a second meter unnecessary .
falling petroleum prices [SEP] commercial solar water heat ##ers began appearing in the united states in the 1890s . these systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels . as with photo ##vo ##lta ##ics , solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices . development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and growth rates have averaged 20 % per year since 1999 . although generally under ##est ##imated , solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154 g ##w as of 2007 .
geography , time variation , cloud cover , and the land available to humans [SEP] the potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography , time variation , cloud cover , and the land available to humans limits the amount of solar energy that we can acquire .
areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation [SEP] geography effects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation . however , the use of photo ##vo ##lta ##ics that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator . time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the earth for solar panels to absorb . this limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day . cloud cover can effect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells .

driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce [SEP] beginning with the surge in coal use which accompanied the industrial revolution , energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels . the early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce . however , development of solar technologies st ##ag ##nated in the early 20th century in the face of the increasing availability , economy , and utility of coal and petroleum .
it was leaked [SEP] carrying a louis vu ##itt ##on backpack filled with old disks and demos to the studio and back , west crafted much of his production for his debut album in less than fifteen minutes at a time . he recorded the remainder of the album in los angeles while recovering from the car accident . once he had completed the album , it was leaked months before its release date . however , west decided to use the opportunity to review the album , and the college drop ##out was significantly remixed , remastered , and revised before being released . as a result , certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted , among them " keep the receipt " with ol ' dirty bastard and " the good , the bad , and the ugly " with consequence . west met ##ic ##ulously refined the production , adding string arrangements , gospel choirs , improved drum programming and new verses . west ' s perfection ##ism led the college drop ##out to have its release postponed three times from its initial date in august 2003 .
shut down [SEP] in august 2008 , west revealed plans to open 10 fat ##burg ##er restaurants in the chicago area ; the first was set to open in september 2008 in or ##land park . the second followed in january 2009 , while a third location is yet to be revealed , although the process is being finalized . his company , kw foods llc , bought the rights to the chain in chicago . ultimately , in 2009 , only two locations actually opened . in february 2011 , west shut down the fat ##burg ##er located in or ##land park . later that year , the remaining beverly location also was shutter ##ed .
rick kaplan cut off the microphone and then cut away to chris tucker [SEP] myers spoke next and continued to read the script . once it was west ' s turn to speak again , he said , " george bush doesn ' t care about black people . " at this point , tel ##eth ##on producer rick kaplan cut off the microphone and then cut away to chris tucker , who was unaware of the cut for a few seconds . still , west ' s comment reached much of the united states .
he learned of the suffering of ordinary people [SEP] sud ##dh ##oda ##na was determined to see his son become a king , so he prevented him from leaving the palace grounds . but at age 29 , despite his father ' s efforts , ga ##uta ##ma ventured beyond the palace several times . in a series of encounters — known in buddhist literature as the four sights — he learned of the suffering of ordinary people , encounter ##ing an old man , a sick man , a corpse and , finally , an as ##ce ##tic holy man , apparently content and at peace with the world . these experiences prompted ga ##uta ##ma to abandon royal life and take up a spiritual quest .
because things are imp ##erman ##ent [SEP] imp ##erman ##ence ( pali : an ##ic ##ca ) expresses the buddhist notion that all compound ##ed or conditioned phenomena ( all things and experiences ) are inc ##ons ##tan ##t , un ##stead ##y , and imp ##erman ##ent . everything we can experience through our senses is made up of parts , and its existence is dependent on external conditions . everything is in constant flux , and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing . things are constantly coming into being , and ce ##asi ##ng to be . since nothing lasts , there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience . according to the doctrine of imp ##erman ##ence , life em ##bo ##dies this flux in the aging process , the cycle of rebirth ( sam ##sar ##a ) , and in any experience of loss . the doctrine asserts that because things are imp ##erman ##ent , attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering ( du ##kk ##ha ) .

for their behaviors . [SEP] unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production - related traits , dogs were initially selected for their behaviors . in 2016 , a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs . these gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution , and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestic ##ation . these genes have been shown to have an impact on the cat ##ech ##ola ##mine synthesis pathway , with the majority of the genes affecting the fight - or - flight response ( i . e . selection for tame ##ness ) , and emotional processing . dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves . some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds , indicating their importance in both the initial domestic ##ation and then later in breed formation .
to balance the body ' s heat [SEP] the most popular korean dog dish is ga ##ej ##ang - gu ##k ( also called bo ##sin ##tang ) , a spicy stew meant to balance the body ' s heat during the summer months ; followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one ' s gi , or vital energy of the body . a 19th century version of ga ##ej ##ang - gu ##k explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with sc ##all ##ions and chili powder . variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots . while the dishes are still popular in korea with a segment of the population , dog is not as widely consumed as beef , chicken , and pork .

" pro - democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch supporters with insults like " running dog , " " traitor , " " get out ! , " and " i love the communist party . " at the same time , about 10 members of the civil human rights front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage . on ##lo ##oke ##rs were saying " aren ' t you chinese ? " in mandarin put ##ong ##hua as they tried to cover the orange banners with a large chinese national flag . one woman had an orange sign that said , " olympic flame for democracy " , while a man carried a poster with a tank and the slogan " one world , two dreams " . a university student and former rd ##h ##k radio host christina chan wrapped the tibetan snow lion flag around her body and later began waving it . several on ##lo ##oke ##rs heck ##led chan , shouting " what kind of chinese are you ?

" hollywood actress mia far ##row was also briefly questioned at the hong kong airport though officials allowed her to enter . she later gave a speech criticizing china ' s relations with sudan in hong kong , as there was also a small minority of people protesting about china ' s role in the crisis of dar ##fur . legislator cheung man kw ##ong have also said the government ' s decision allowing far ##row to enter while denying others is a double standard and a violation to hong kong ' s one country , two systems policy .
civil war [SEP] economic reform efforts continued with the support of international organizations , notably the world bank and the international monetary fund . the reform program came to a halt in june 1997 when civil war erupted . when sas ##so ##u ng ##ues ##so returned to power at the end of the war in october 1997 , he publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renew ##ing cooperation with international financial institutions . however , economic progress was badly hurt by slump ##ing oil prices and the res ##ump ##tion of armed conflict in december 1998 , which worsened the republic ' s budget deficit .
high taxes , persecution of protestants by the government , and philip ' s efforts to modern ##ize and central ##ize the dev ##olved - medieval government structures of the provinces [SEP] most of the low countries had come under the rule of the house of burgundy and subsequently the house of habsburg . in 154 ##9 holy roman emperor charles v issued the pr ##ag ##matic san ##ction , which further unified the seventeen provinces under his rule . charles was succeeded by his son , king philip ii of spain . in 156 ##8 the netherlands , led by william i of orange , revolt ##ed against philip ii because of high taxes , persecution of protestants by the government , and philip ' s efforts to modern ##ize and central ##ize the dev ##olved - medieval government structures of the provinces . this was the start of the eighty years ' war .
this area was so poor it was exempt from paying federal taxes [SEP] in fact , there was an eighth province , the county of dr ##ent ##he , but this area was so poor it was exempt from paying federal taxes and as a consequence was denied representation in the states general . each province was governed by the provincial states , the main executive official ( though not the official head of state ) was a ra ##ads ##pen ##sion ##aris . in times of war , the st ##adt ##holder , who commanded the army , would have more power than the ra ##ads ##pen ##sion ##aris .
to protect the hive [SEP] syn ##ne ##cr ##osis is a rare type of sy ##mb ##ios ##is in which the interaction between species is detrimental to both organisms involved . it is a short - lived condition , as the interaction eventually causes death . because of this , evolution selects against syn ##ne ##cr ##osis and it is uncommon in nature . an example of this is the relationship between some species of bees and victims of the bee sting . species of bees who die after stinging their prey in ##flict pain on themselves ( albeit to protect the hive ) as well as on the victim . this term is rarely used .
the department changed its policies [SEP] in the 1950s , the recruitment of women was open to roles in medicine , communication , logistics , and administration . the roles of women in the caf began to expand in 1971 , after the department reviewed the recommendations of the royal commission on the status of women , at which time it lifted the ceiling of 1 , 500 women personnel , and gradually expanded employment opportunities into the non - traditional areas — vehicle drivers and mechanics , aircraft mechanics , air - traffic controllers , military police , and firefighters . the department further reviewed personnel policies in 1978 and 1985 , after parliament passed the canadian human rights act and the canadian charter of rights and freedoms . as a result of these reviews , the department changed its policies to permit women to serve at sea in rep ##len ##ishment ships and in a diving tender , with the army service battalions , in military police platoon ##s and field ambulance units , and in most air squadrons .
because they do not belong to the roman clergy [SEP] in accordance with tradition , they sign by placing the title " cardinal " ( abbreviated card . ) after their personal name and before their surname as , for instance , " john card ( ina ##l ) doe " or , in latin , " io ##anne ##s card ( ina ##lis ) co ##gno ##men " . some writers , such as james - charles noon ##an , hold that , in the case of cardinals , the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in english . official sources such as the archdiocese of milwaukee and catholic news service say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in english is normally as " cardinal [ first name ] [ surname ] " . this is the rule given also in style ##books not associated with the catholic church . this style is also generally followed on the websites of the holy see and episcopal conferences . oriental patriarch ##s who are created cardinals custom ##ari ##ly use " san ##cta ##e ec ##cles ##iae cardinal ##is " as their full title , probably because they do not belong to the roman clergy .
to preserve apostolic succession [SEP] in early times , the privilege of papal election was not reserved to the cardinals , and for centuries the person elected was custom ##ari ##ly a roman priest and never a bishop from elsewhere . to preserve apostolic succession the rite of con ##se ##crat ##ing him a bishop had to be performed by someone who was already a bishop . the rule remains that , if the person elected pope is not yet a bishop , he is consecrated by the dean of the college of cardinals , the cardinal bishop of os ##tia .

the cardinal ##ate ex ##pire ##s [SEP] if conditions change , so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public , he may do so at any time . the cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those raised to the cardinal ##ate at the time of his in pe ##ctor ##e appointment . if a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pe ##ctor ##e cardinal , the cardinal ##ate ex ##pire ##s .
higher lighting levels [SEP] beyond the energy factors being considered , it is important not to over - design illumination , lest adverse health effects such as headache frequency , stress , and increased blood pressure be induced by the higher lighting levels . in addition , glare or excess light can decrease worker efficiency .
disrupt the natural circa ##dian cycle [SEP] analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting , but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used . not only will greater reliance on natural light reduce energy consumption , but will favorably impact human health and performance . new studies have shown that the performance of students is influenced by the time and duration of daylight in their regular schedules . designing school facilities to incorporate the right types of light at the right time of day for the right duration may improve student performance and well - being . similarly , designing lighting systems that maximize the right amount of light at the appropriate time of day for the elderly may help relieve symptoms of alzheimer ' s disease . the human circa ##dian system is en ##train ##ed to a 24 - hour light - dark pattern that mimic ##s the earth ’ s natural light / dark pattern . when those patterns are disrupted , they disrupt the natural circa ##dian cycle . circa ##dian disruption may lead to numerous health problems including breast cancer , seasonal affect ##ive disorder , delayed sleep phase syndrome , and other ai ##lm ##ents .
glare [SEP] light pollution is a growing problem in reaction to excess light being given off by numerous signs , houses , and buildings . poll ##uting light is often wasted light involving unnecessary energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions . light pollution is described as artificial light that is excessive or int ##rud ##es where it is not wanted . well - designed lighting sends light only where it is needed without scattering it elsewhere . poorly designed lighting can also compromise safety . for example , glare creates safety issues around buildings by causing very sharp shadows , temporarily blinding pass ##ers ##by making them vulnerable to would - be ass ##ail ##ants .
a surplus in production [SEP] it is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error , with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory . what is termed vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world . indeed , vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day . early human settlements were mostly rural . due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urban ##ization thus creating urban areas which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases , such as that of cat ##al ho ##yu ##k in anatolia and mo ##hen ##jo dar ##o of the indus valley civilization in modern - day pakistan .
the onset of new media outlets and technology [SEP] the bbc television department headed by jana bennett was absorbed into a new , much larger group ; bbc vision , in late 2006 . the new group was part of larger restructuring within the bbc with the onset of new media outlets and technology .
stroke [SEP] on may 20 , 1971 , his brother , mein ##hard , died in a car accident . mein ##hard had been drinking and was killed instantly . schwarz ##ene ##gger did not attend his funeral . mein ##hard was due to marry erika kn ##app , and the couple had a three - year - old son , patrick . schwarz ##ene ##gger would pay for patrick ' s education and help him to emi ##grate to the united states . gustav died the following year from a stroke . in pumping iron , schwarz ##ene ##gger claimed that he did not attend his father ' s funeral because he was training for a body ##building contest . later , he and the film ' s producer said this story was taken from another body ##bu ##ilde ##r for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport and to make schwarz ##ene ##gger ' s image more cold and machine - like in order to fan controversy for the film . barbara baker , his first serious girlfriend , has said he informed her of his father ' s death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother . over time , he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father ' s funeral .
ex ##com ##mun ##icated [SEP] within six years of the official criminal ##ization of heresy by the emperor , the first christian here ##tic to be executed , pri ##sc ##ill ##ian , was condemned in 38 ##6 by roman secular officials for so ##rce ##ry , and put to death with four or five followers . however , his accuse ##rs were ex ##com ##mun ##icated both by ambrose of milan and pope sir ##ici ##us , who opposed pri ##sc ##ill ##ian ' s heresy , but " believed capital punishment to be inappropriate at best and usually une ##qui ##vo ##cal ##ly evil " . for some years after the reformation , protestant churches were also known to execute those they considered here ##tics , including catholics . the last known here ##tic executed by sentence of the roman catholic church was spanish school ##master ca ##ye ##tan ##o rip ##oll in 1826 . the number of people executed as here ##tics under the authority of the various " ecclesiastical authorities " [ note 1 ] is not known . [ note 2 ] one of the first examples of the word as translated from the na ##g ham ##mad ##i ' s apocalypse of peter was " they will cl ##ea ##ve to the name of a dead man thinking that they will become pure . but they will become greatly def ##iled and they will fall into the name of error and into the hands of an evil cunning man and a manifold dog ##ma , and they will be ruled here ##tically " .
the fall of mo ##sul [SEP] in arabic - speaking cultures , two words are commonly used for christians : nas ##rani ( ن ##ص ##ر ##ان ##ي ) , plural nasa ##ra ( ن ##ص ##ا ##ر ##ى ) is generally understood to be derived from nazareth through the syriac ( aramaic ) ; mas ##ih ##i ( م ##س ##ي ##ح ##ي ) means followers of the messiah . the term nasa ##ra rose to prominence in july 2014 , after the fall of mo ##sul to the terrorist organization islamic state of iraq and the levant . the nun or ن — the first letter of nasa ##ra — was spray - painted on the property of christians ejected from the city .
agricultural societies increased [SEP] as the number and size of agricultural societies increased , they expanded into lands traditionally used by hunter - gather ##ers . this process of agriculture - driven expansion led to the development of the first forms of government in agricultural centers , such as the fertile crescent , ancient india , ancient china , ol ##me ##c , sub - saharan africa and norte chico .
mobility [SEP] at the 1966 " man the hunter " conference , anthropologist ##s richard bo ##rs ##hay lee and ir ##ven dev ##ore suggested that e ##gal ##itarian ##ism was one of several central characteristics of nomadic hunting and gathering societies because mobility requires mini ##mi ##zation of material possessions throughout a population . therefore , no surplus of resources can be accumulated by any single member . other characteristics lee and dev ##ore proposed were flux in territorial boundaries as well as in demographic composition .
pushed into marginal areas [SEP] in the early 1980s , a small but vocal segment of anthropologist ##s and archaeologists attempted to demonstrate that contemporary groups usually identified as hunter - gather ##ers do not , in most cases , have a continuous history of hunting and gathering , and that in many cases their ancestors were agricultural ##ists and / or pastoral ##ists [ citation needed ] who were pushed into marginal areas as a result of migration ##s , economic exploitation , and / or violent conflict ( see , for example , the kala ##hari debate ) . the result of their effort has been the general acknowledge ##ment that there has been complex interaction between hunter - gather ##ers and non - hunter - gather ##ers for millennia . [ citation needed ]
to escape colonial control [SEP] some agricultural ##ists also regularly hunt and gather ( e . g . , farming during the frost - free season and hunting during the winter ) . still others in developed countries go hunting , primarily for leisure . in the brazilian rainforest , those groups that recently did , or even continue to , rely on hunting and gathering techniques seem to have adopted this lifestyle , abandoning most agriculture , as a way to escape colonial control and as a result of the introduction of european diseases reducing their populations to levels where agriculture became difficult .

accusations of collaboration with the invaders and sep ##arat ##ism [SEP] on march 3 , 1944 , on the orders of stalin , the che ##chen - ing ##ush ass ##r was disbanded and its population forcibly deported upon the accusations of collaboration with the invaders and sep ##arat ##ism . the territory of the ass ##r was divided between other administrative unit of russian sf ##sr and the georgian ssr .
tied behind their backs [SEP] several influential people of the time , including bell , viewed deaf ##ness as something that should be era ##dicated , and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language , thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded . in several schools , children were mist ##reate ##d , for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing — the only language they knew — in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication . owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language , bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing deaf culture .
a network between government research laboratories and participating departments of universities [SEP] the internet was developed as a network between government research laboratories and participating departments of universities . by the late 1980s , a process was set in place towards public , commercial use of the internet . the remaining restrictions were removed by 1995 , 4 years after the introduction of the world wide web .

leading a zulu army against british rule [SEP] the island was uninhabited when discovered by the portuguese in 150 ##2 . one of the most remote islands in the world , it was for centuries an important stop ##over for ships sailing to europe from asia and south africa . napoleon was imprisoned there in exile by the british , as were din ##uz ##ulu ka ##ce ##ts ##hwa ##yo ( for leading a zulu army against british rule ) and more than 5 , 000 boer ##s taken prisoner during the second boer war .
loss of full passports [SEP] one commentator has observed that , notwithstanding the high unemployment resulting from the loss of full passports during 1981 – 2002 , the level of loyalty to the british monarchy by the st helena population is probably not exceeded in any other part of the world . king george vi is the only reigning monarch to have visited the island . this was in 1947 when the king , accompanied by queen elizabeth ( later the queen mother ) , princess elizabeth ( later queen elizabeth ii ) and princess margaret were travelling to south africa . prince philip arrived at st helena in 1957 and then his son prince andrew visited as a member of the armed forces in 1984 and his sister the princess royal arrived in 2002 .
the stop is held longer and then has an as ##pi ##rated release . [SEP] when as ##pi ##rated consonants are doubled or gem ##inated , the stop is held longer and then has an as ##pi ##rated release . an as ##pi ##rated af ##fr ##icate consists of a stop , fr ##icative , and as ##pi ##rated release . a doubled as ##pi ##rated af ##fr ##icate has a longer hold in the stop portion and then has a release consisting of the fr ##icative and as ##piration .
hydrogen combustion [SEP] hydrogen gas forms explosive mixture ##s with air if it is 4 – 74 % concentrated and with ch ##lor ##ine if it is 5 – 95 % concentrated . the mixture ##s may be ignited by spark , heat or sunlight . the hydrogen auto ##ign ##ition temperature , the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air , is 500 °c ( 93 ##2 °f ) . pure hydrogen - oxygen flames emi ##t ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye , as illustrated by the faint plume of the space shuttle main engine compared to the highly visible plume of a space shuttle solid rocket booster . the detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a flame detector ; such leaks can be very dangerous . hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue , resembling blue natural gas flames . the destruction of the hind ##enburg airship was an infamous example of hydrogen combustion ; the cause is debated , but the visible orange flames were the result of a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon compounds from the airship skin .

h   y   d   r   o   g   e   n       c   o   m   b   u   s   t   i   o   n [SEP] 2 has wide applications in physics and engineering . it is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding . h ##2 is used as the rotor cool ##ant in electrical generators at power stations , because it has the highest thermal conduct ##ivity of any gas . liquid h ##2 is used in cry ##ogenic research , including super ##con ##du ##ct ##ivity studies . because h
it has the highest thermal conduct ##ivity of any gas [SEP] 2 is lighter than air , having a little more than 1 ##⁄ ##14 of the density of air , it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airship ##s .
as a trace ##r gas for minute leak detection [SEP] in more recent applications , hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen ( sometimes called forming gas ) as a trace ##r gas for minute leak detection . applications can be found in the automotive , chemical , power generation , aerospace , and telecommunications industries . hydrogen is an authorized food additive ( e 94 ##9 ) that allows food package leak testing among other anti - ox ##idi ##zing properties .
favorable properties that are a direct result of its light dia ##tom ##ic molecules [SEP] hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a cool ##ant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light dia ##tom ##ic molecules . these include low density , low vis ##cos ##ity , and the highest specific heat and thermal conduct ##ivity of all gases .
to sat ##ura ##te broken ( " dangling " ) bonds of amor ##ph ##ous silicon and amor ##ph ##ous carbon that helps stab ##ili ##zing material properties [SEP] hydrogen is employed to sat ##ura ##te broken ( " dangling " ) bonds of amor ##ph ##ous silicon and amor ##ph ##ous carbon that helps stab ##ili ##zing material properties . it is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials , including z ##no , s ##no ##2 , cd ##o , mg ##o , z ##ro ##2 , h ##fo ##2 , la ##2 ##o ##3 , y ##2 ##o ##3 , ti ##o ##2 , sr ##ti ##o ##3 , la ##alo ##3 , si ##o ##2 , al ##2 ##o ##3 , z ##rs ##io ##4 , h ##fs ##io ##4 , and sr ##z ##ro ##3 .

soft ##ening [SEP] the early 1990s marked the soft ##ening of urban r & b at the same time alternative rock emerged and traditional pop saw a significant resurgence . this in part led to a widening of the market , not only allowing to cater to more niche markets , but it also became customary for artists to make ac - friendly singles .
too alternative [SEP] with the mixture of radio friendly ac tunes with some rock and pop fare also landing on the pop charts , mainstream songs won over many critics in the need to define ac , and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of ac music into mainstream day to day radio play . part of the reason why more and more hot ac stations are forced to change is that less and less new music fits their bill ; most new rock is too alternative for mainstream radio and most new pop is now influenced heavily by dance - pop and electronic dance music .
aging demographics [SEP] the soft ac format may soon be facing the demographic pressures that the jazz and big band formats faced in the 1960s and 1970s and that the oldies format is starting to face today , with the result that one may hear soft ac less on over - the - air radio and more on satellite radio systems in coming years . much of the music and artists that were traditionally played on soft ac stations have been relegated to the adult standards format , which is itself disappearing because of aging demographics . some soft ac stations have found a niche by incorporating more oldies into their play ##lists and are more open to playing softer songs that fit the " traditional " definition of ac .
extension of ds ##t [SEP] several studies have suggested that ds ##t increases motor fuel consumption . the 2008 doe report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the 2007 united states extension of ds ##t .
changes to ds ##t rules [SEP] changes to ds ##t rules cause problems in existing computer installations . for example , the 2007 change to ds ##t rules in north america required many computer systems to be upgraded , with the greatest impact on email and calendar ##ing programs ; the upgrades consumed a significant effort by corporate information techno ##logists .

a yiddish speaker would not consult a german dictionary [SEP] another occasionally used criterion for disc ##rim ##inating dialects from languages is that of linguistic authority , a more socio ##ling ##uis ##tic notion . according to this definition , two varieties are considered dialects of the same language if ( under at least some circumstances ) they would def ##er to the same authority regarding some questions about their language . for instance , to learn the name of a new invention , or an obscure foreign species of plant , speakers of bavarian german and east franco ##nian german might each consult a german dictionary or ask a german - speaking expert in the subject . by way of contrast , although yiddish is classified by linguist ##s as a language in the " middle high german " group of languages , a yiddish speaker would not consult a german dictionary to determine the word to use in such a case .

the two countries os ##ci ##lla ##te from being brother ##ly to being bitter enemies [SEP] the classification of speech varieties as dialects or languages and their relationship to other varieties of speech can be controversial and the verdict ##s inconsistent . english and serb ##o - croatian illustrate the point . english and serb ##o - croatian each have two major variants ( british and american english , and serbian and croatian , respectively ) , along with numerous other varieties . for political reasons , analyzing these varieties as " languages " or " dialects " yields inconsistent results : british and american english , spoken by close political and military allies , are almost universally regarded as dialects of a single language , whereas the standard languages of serbia and croatia , which differ from each other to a similar extent as the dialects of english , are being treated by some linguist ##s from the region as distinct languages , largely because the two countries os ##ci ##lla ##te from being brother ##ly to being bitter enemies . ( the serb ##o - croatian language article deals with this topic much more fully . )

did not write many symphonies [SEP] almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the standard concert repertoire are male composers , even though there has been a large number of women composers throughout the classical music period . music ##ologist marcia ci ##tron has asked " [ w ] h ##y is music composed by women so marginal to the standard ' classical ' repertoire ? " ci ##tron " examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received ' canon ' of performed musical works . " she argues that in the 1800s , women composers typically wrote art songs for performance in small recital ##s rather than symphonies intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall , with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers ; since women composers did not write many symphonies , they were deemed to be not notable as composers . in the " . . . con ##cise oxford history of music , clara shu ##mann [ sic ] is one of the only [ sic ] female composers mentioned . " abbey philips states that " [ d ] ur ##ing the 20th century the women who were composing / playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts . "
contains the technical instructions for performing the work [SEP] the modernist views hold that classical music is considered primarily a written musical tradition , preserved in music notation , as opposed to being transmitted oral ##ly , by rot ##e , or by recordings of particular performances . [ citation needed ] while there are differences between particular performances of a classical work , a piece of classical music is generally held to trans ##cend any interpretation of it . the use of musical notation is an effective method for transmitting classical music , since the written music contains the technical instructions for performing the work .
moderately lower [SEP] in 1996 – 1997 , a research study was conducted on a large population of middle age students in the cherry creek school district in denver , colorado , usa . the study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores . the research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores . students who listened to rock - and - roll or country had moderately lower scores . the study further indicated that students who used classical during the course of study had a significant leap in their academic performance ; whereas , those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores . the research was conducted over several schools within the cherry creek school district and was conducted through university of colorado . this study is reflective of several recent studies ( i . e . mike man ##the ##i and steve n . kelly of the university of nebraska at omaha ; donald a . hodges and debra s . o ' connell of the university of north carolina at greensboro ; etc . ) and others who had significant results through the discourse of their work .

drop out completely [SEP] when a state limits its treaty obligations through reservations , other states party to that treaty have the option to accept those reservations , object to them , or object and oppose them . if the state accepts them ( or fails to act at all ) , both the res ##erving state and the accepting state are relieved of the reserved legal obligation as concerns their legal obligations to each other ( accepting the reservation does not change the accepting state ' s legal obligations as concerns other parties to the treaty ) . if the state opposes , the parts of the treaty affected by the reservation drop out completely and no longer create any legal obligations on the res ##erving and accepting state , again only as concerns each other . finally , if the state objects and opposes , there are no legal obligations under that treaty between those two state parties whatsoever . the object ##ing and opposing state essentially refuses to acknowledge the res ##erving state is a party to the treaty at all .
terminated [SEP] if a state party ' s withdrawal is successful , its obligations under that treaty are considered terminated , and withdrawal by one party from a bilateral treaty of course terminates the treaty . when a state withdraw ##s from a multi - lateral treaty , that treaty will still otherwise remain in force among the other parties , unless , of course , otherwise should or could be interpreted as agreed upon between the remaining states parties to the treaty .

included those almost rich and powerful enough to be magnate ##s down to ras ##cal ##s [SEP] in the past , a certain mis ##con ##ception sometimes led to the mist ##ran ##sl ##ation of " s ##z ##la ##cht ##a " as " gentry " rather than " nobility " . : 206 : xvi this mistaken practice began due to the economic status of some s ##z ##la ##cht ##a members being inferior to that of the nobility in other european countries ( see also estates of the realm regarding wealth and nobility ) . the s ##z ##la ##cht ##a included those almost rich and powerful enough to be magnate ##s down to ras ##cal ##s with a noble lineage , no land , no castle , no money , no village , and no peasants . : xvi
the extinction of the male - line descendants of the old royal dynasty [SEP] the polish nobility enjoyed many rights that were not available to the noble classes of other countries and , typically , each new monarch conceded them further privileges . those privileges became the basis of the golden liberty in the polish – lithuanian commonwealth . despite having a king , poland was called the nobility ' s commonwealth because the king was elected by all interested members of hereditary nobility and poland was considered to be the property of this class , not of the king or the ruling dynasty . this state of affairs grew up in part because of the extinction of the male - line descendants of the old royal dynasty ( first the pia ##sts , then the ja ##gie ##llon ##s ) , and the selection by the nobility of the polish king from among the dynasty ' s female - line descendants .
in order to guarantee the polish throne for his daughter ja ##d ##wig ##a [SEP] in 137 ##4 king louis of hungary approved the privilege of ko ##sz ##yce ( polish : " pr ##zy ##wil ##ej ko ##sz ##yck ##i " or " u ##go ##da ko ##sz ##yck ##a " ) in ko ##sic ##e in order to guarantee the polish throne for his daughter ja ##d ##wig ##a . he broad ##ened the definition of who was a member of the nobility and exempt ##ed the entire class from all but one tax ( ł ##ano ##wy , which was limited to 2 gr ##os ##ze from ł ##an ( an old measure of land size ) ) . in addition , the king ' s right to raise taxes was abolished ; no new taxes could be raised without the agreement of the nobility . hence ##forth , also , district offices ( polish : " ur ##zed ##y z ##ie ##ms ##kie " ) were reserved exclusively for local nobility , as the privilege of ko ##sz ##yce forbade the king to grant official posts and major polish castles to foreign knights . finally , this privilege obliged the king to pay ind ##em ##ni ##ties to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside polish borders .

[SEP] about that time the " execution ##ist movement " ( polish : " e ##g ##zek ##uc ##ja pr ##aw " - - " execution of the laws " ) began to take form . its members would seek to curb the power of the magnate ##s at the se ##jm and to strengthen the power of king and country . in 156 ##2 at the se ##jm in pi ##ot ##rk ##ow they would force the magnate ##s to return many leased crown lands to the king , and the king to create a standing army ( wo ##js ##ko kw ##ar ##cian ##e ) . one of the most famous members of this movement was jan za ##mo ##ys ##ki . after his death in 1605 , the movement lost its political force .
actually gained power [SEP] the polish nobility differed in many respects from the nobility of other countries . the most important difference was that , while in most european countries the nobility lost power as the ruler st ##rove for absolute monarchy , in poland the reverse process occurred : the nobility actually gained power at the expense of the king , and the political system evolved into an ol ##iga ##rchy .
the nobility became almost exclusively catholic [SEP] prior to the reformation , the polish nobility were mostly either roman catholic or orthodox with a small group of muslims . many families , however , soon adopted the reformed faith ##s . after the counter - reformation , when the roman catholic church regained power in poland , the nobility became almost exclusively catholic , despite the fact that roman catholicism was not the majority religion in commonwealth ( the catholic and orthodox churches each accounted for some 40 % of all citizens population , with the remaining 20 % being jews or members of protestant denominations ) . in the 18th century , many followers of jacob frank joined the ranks of jewish - descended polish gentry . although jewish religion wasn ' t usually a pre ##text to block or de ##pr ##ive of noble status , some laws favoured religious conversion from judaism to christianity ( see : neo ##phy ##te ) by reward ##ing it with en ##nob ##lem ##ent .
a late - stage oro ##geny [SEP] the alpine oro ##geny occurred in ongoing cycles through to the pale ##ogen ##e causing differences in nap ##pe structures , with a late - stage oro ##geny causing the development of the ju ##ra mountains . a series of te ##cton ##ic events in the triassic , jurassic and cretaceous periods caused different pale ##oge ##ographic regions . the alps are subdivided by different lit ##hol ##ogy ( rock composition ) and nap ##pe structure according to the oro ##genic events that affected them . the geological subdivision differentiate ##s the western , eastern alps and southern alps : the he ##l ##vet ##icum in the north , the penn ##ini ##cum and austro ##al ##pine system in the center and , south of the per ##iad ##ria ##tic seam , the southern alpine system .
a meta ##morphic event [SEP] according to geologist stefan sc ##hmi ##d , because the western alps underwent a meta ##morphic event in the ce ##no ##zo ##ic era while the austro ##al ##pine peaks underwent an event in the cretaceous period , the two areas show distinct differences in nap ##pe formations . fly ##sch deposits in the southern alps of lombardy probably occurred in the cretaceous or later .
folded and fractured [SEP] the core regions of the alpine oro ##genic belt have been folded and fractured in such a manner that erosion created the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the swiss alps that rise seemingly straight out of the fore ##land areas . peaks such as mont blanc , the matter ##horn , and high peaks in the penn ##ine alps , the brian ##con ##nais , and ho ##he tau ##ern consist of layers of rock from the various oro ##gen ##ies including exposure ##s of basement rock .
the stress of the movement [SEP] alpine glaciers can be straight rivers of ice , long sweeping rivers , spread in a fan - like shape ( piedmont glaciers ) , and curtains of ice that hang from vertical slopes of the mountain peaks . the stress of the movement causes the ice to break and crack loudly , perhaps explaining why the mountains were believed to be home to dragons in the medieval period . the cracking creates unpredictable and dangerous cr ##eva ##sse ##s , often invisible under new snowfall , which cause the greatest danger to mountain ##eers .
a piece of glacier will det ##ach or break [SEP] glaciers end in ice caves ( the rhone glacier ) , by trailing into a lake or river , or by shed ##ding snow ##mel ##t on a meadow . sometimes a piece of glacier will det ##ach or break resulting in flooding , property damage and loss of life . in the 17th century about 2500 people were killed by an avalanche in a village on the french - italian border ; in the 19th century 120 homes in a village near ze ##rma ##tt were destroyed by an avalanche .
a rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere [SEP] the alps are a classic example of what happens when a temperate area at lower altitude gives way to higher - elevation terrain . elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the polar regions have been called alpine . a rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease ( see adi ##aba ##tic laps ##e rate ) . the effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone , where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportion ##ate loss of temperature , often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain . the height of the alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks .
because of regional fluctuations in tree lines . [SEP] above the forestry , there is often a band of short pine trees ( pin ##us mug ##o ) , which is in turn superseded by al ##pen ##rose ##n , dwarf shrubs , typically r ##ho ##do ##den ##dron fe ##rr ##ug ##ine ##um ( on acid soils ) or r ##ho ##do ##den ##dron hi ##rs ##ut ##um ( on al ##kali ##ne soils ) . although the al ##pen ##rose prefers acidic soil , the plants are found throughout the region . above the tree line is the area defined as " alpine " where in the alpine meadow plants are found that have adapted well to harsh conditions of cold temperatures , arid ##ity , and high altitudes . the alpine area flu ##ct ##uate ##s greatly because of regional fluctuations in tree lines .
they cannot bear the cold temperatures [SEP] reptiles such as add ##ers and viper ##s live up to the snow line ; because they cannot bear the cold temperatures they hi ##ber ##nate underground and so ##ak up the warmth on rocky ledge ##s . the high - altitude alpine sal ##aman ##ders have adapted to living above the snow line by giving birth to fully developed young rather than laying eggs . brown trout can be found in the streams up to the snow line . mo ##llus ##cs such as the wood snail live up the snow line . popularly gathered as food , the snails are now protected .
to keep them dry [SEP] about 10 , 000 years ago , when the ice melted after the last glacial period , late pale ##oli ##thic communities were established along the lake shores and in cave systems . evidence of human habitat ##ion has been found in caves near ve ##rco ##rs , close to gr ##eno ##ble ; in austria the mon ##ds ##ee culture shows evidence of houses built on piles to keep them dry . standing stones have been found in alpine areas of france and italy . the rock drawings in val ##cam ##onic ##a are more than 5000 years old ; more than 200 , 000 drawings and etc ##hing ##s have been identified at the site .
to protect the major alpine passes [SEP] after the fall of napoleon , many alpine countries developed heavy protections to prevent any new invasion . thus , savoy built a series of fortifications in the ma ##uri ##enne valley in order to protect the major alpine passes , such as the col du mont - ce ##nis that was even crossed by , charlemagne and his father to defeat the lo ##mba ##rts . the later indeed became very popular after the construction of a paved road ordered by napoleon bonaparte . the barrier ##e de l ' es ##sei ##llon is a serie of forts with heavy batteries , built on a cliff with a perfect view on the valley , a gorge on one side and steep mountains on the other side .
because of the steep and rocky topography of the alps [SEP] farming had been a traditional occupation for centuries , although it became less dominant in the 20th century with the advent of tourism . grazing and pasture land are limited because of the steep and rocky topography of the alps . in mid - june cows are moved to the highest pastures close to the snow ##line , where they are watched by herds ##men who stay in the high altitudes often living in stone huts or wooden barns during the summers . villagers celebrate the day the cows are herd ##ed up to the pastures and again when they return in mid - september . the al ##pan ##sch ##lus ##s or des ##al ##pes ( " coming down from the alps " ) is celebrated by decor ##ating the cows with garland ##s and enormous cow ##bell ##s while the farmers dress in traditional costumes .
reasons of sustainability [SEP] some high mountain villages , such as av ##oria ##z ( in france ) , wen ##gen , and ze ##rma ##tt ( in switzerland ) are accessible only by cable car or co ##g - rail trains , and are car free . other villages in the alps are considering becoming car free zones or limiting the number of cars for reasons of sustainability of the fragile alpine terrain .
natural selection or survival of the fit ##test of the all ##eles [SEP] genes can acquire mutations in their sequence , leading to different variants , known as all ##eles , in the population . these all ##eles en ##code slightly different versions of a protein , which cause different ph ##eno ##type traits . col ##lo ##qui ##al usage of the term " having a gene " ( e . g . , " good genes , " " hair colour gene " ) typically refers to having a different all ##ele of the gene . genes evolve due to natural selection or survival of the fit ##test of the all ##eles .
aden ##ine and thy ##mine align form two hydrogen bonds , whereas cy ##tos ##ine and gu ##ani ##ne form three hydrogen bonds [SEP] two chains of dna twist around each other to form a dna double helix with the phosphate - sugar backbone spiral ##ling around the outside , and the bases pointing inward ##s with aden ##ine base pairing to thy ##mine and gu ##ani ##ne to cy ##tos ##ine . the specific ##ity of base pairing occurs because aden ##ine and thy ##mine align form two hydrogen bonds , whereas cy ##tos ##ine and gu ##ani ##ne form three hydrogen bonds . the two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary , with their sequence of bases matching such that the aden ##ines of one strand are paired with the thy ##mine ##s of the other strand , and so on . : 4 . 1
the chemical composition of the pen ##tose residues of the bases [SEP] due to the chemical composition of the pen ##tose residues of the bases , dna strands have directional ##ity . one end of a dna polymer contains an exposed hydro ##xy ##l group on the de ##ox ##yr ##ib ##ose ; this is known as the 3 ' end of the molecule . the other end contains an exposed phosphate group ; this is the 5 ' end . the two strands of a double - helix run in opposite directions . nuclei ##c acid synthesis , including dna replication and transcription occurs in the 5 ' → ##3 ' direction , because new nu ##cle ##otide ##s are added via a de ##hy ##dra ##tion reaction that uses the exposed 3 ' hydro ##xy ##l as a nu ##cle ##op ##hil ##e . : 27 . 2
because new nu ##cle ##otide ##s are added via a de ##hy ##dra ##tion reaction that uses the exposed 3 ' hydro ##xy ##l as a nu ##cle ##op ##hil ##e [SEP] due to the chemical composition of the pen ##tose residues of the bases , dna strands have directional ##ity . one end of a dna polymer contains an exposed hydro ##xy ##l group on the de ##ox ##yr ##ib ##ose ; this is known as the 3 ' end of the molecule . the other end contains an exposed phosphate group ; this is the 5 ' end . the two strands of a double - helix run in opposite directions . nuclei ##c acid synthesis , including dna replication and transcription occurs in the 5 ' → ##3 ' direction , because new nu ##cle ##otide ##s are added via a de ##hy ##dra ##tion reaction that uses the exposed 3 ' hydro ##xy ##l as a nu ##cle ##op ##hil ##e . : 27 . 2
the dna to loop [SEP] additionally , genes can have regulatory regions many ki ##lo ##base ##s upstream or downstream of the open reading frame . these act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the dna to loop so that the regulatory sequence ( and bound transcription factor ) become close to the rna polymer ##ase binding site . for example , enhance ##rs increase transcription by binding an act ##iva ##tor protein which then helps to recruit the rna polymer ##ase to the promoter ; conversely silence ##rs bind rep ##ress ##or proteins and make the dna less available for rna polymer ##ase .

because the intervening dna can be loop ##ed out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity [SEP] defining exactly what section of a dna sequence comprises a gene is difficult . regulatory regions of a gene such as enhance ##rs do not necessarily have to be close to the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening dna can be loop ##ed out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity . similarly , a gene ' s intro ##ns can be much larger than its ex ##ons . regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome .
because it is synthesis ##ed as the complement of the template strand [SEP] transcription produces a single - stranded rna molecule known as messenger rna , whose nu ##cle ##otide sequence is complementary to the dna from which it was transcribed . : 6 . 1 the mrna acts as an intermediate between the dna gene and its final protein product . the gene ' s dna is used as a template to generate a complementary mrna . the mrna matches the sequence of the gene ' s dna coding strand because it is synthesis ##ed as the complement of the template strand . transcription is performed by an enzyme called an rna polymer ##ase , which reads the template strand in the 3 ' to 5 ' direction and synth ##es ##izes the rna from 5 ' to 3 ' . to initiate transcription , the polymer ##ase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene . thus , a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or se ##quest ##ering the promoter region , either by tight binding by rep ##ress ##or molecules that physically block the polymer ##ase , or by organizing the dna so that the promoter region is not accessible . : 7
because they use rna to store genes [SEP] some viruses store their entire genome ##s in the form of rna , and contain no dna at all . because they use rna to store genes , their cellular hosts may synth ##es ##ize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription . on the other hand , rna retro ##virus ##es , such as hiv , require the reverse transcription of their genome from rna into dna before their proteins can be synthesized . rna - mediated ep ##igen ##etic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals .
because they inherit one complete set from each parent [SEP] organisms inherit their genes from their parents . as ##ex ##ual organisms simply inherit a complete copy of their parent ' s genome . sexual organisms have two copies of each chromosome because they inherit one complete set from each parent . : 1
because the dna double helix is held together by base pairing [SEP] the growth , development , and reproduction of organisms relies on cell division , or the process by which a single cell divides into two usually identical daughter cells . this requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called dna replication . : 5 . 2 the copies are made by specialized enzymes known as dna polymer ##ase ##s , which " read " one strand of the double - he ##lica ##l dna , known as the template strand , and synth ##es ##ize a new complementary strand . because the dna double helix is held together by base pairing , the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement ; hence only one strand needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy . the process of dna replication is semi ##con ##ser ##vati ##ve ; that is , the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand of dna . : 5 . 2
cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents ' cells [SEP] the du ##plication and transmission of genetic material from one generation of cells to the next is the basis for molecular inheritance , and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes . organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents ' cells . in as ##ex ##ually rep ##rod ##uc ##ing organisms , the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism . in sexually rep ##rod ##uc ##ing organisms , a specialized form of cell division called mei ##osis produces cells called game ##tes or ge ##rm cells that are ha ##pl ##oid , or contain only one copy of each gene . : 20 . 2 the game ##tes produced by females are called eggs or o ##va , and those produced by males are called sperm . two game ##tes fuse to form a dip ##loid fe ##rti ##lized egg , a single cell that has two sets of genes , with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father . : 20
the portuguese colonial war and the car ##nation revolution [SEP] guinea - bis ##sau has started to show some economic advances after a pact of stability was signed by the main political parties of the country , leading to an im ##f - backed structural reform program . the key challenges for the country in the period ahead are to achieve fiscal discipline , rebuild public administration , improve the economic climate for private investment , and promote economic divers ##ification . after the country became independent from portugal in 1974 due to the portuguese colonial war and the car ##nation revolution , the rapid exodus of the portuguese civilian , military , and political authorities resulted in considerable damage to the country ' s economic infrastructure , social order , and standard of living .
guinea - bis ##sau is surrounded by french - speaking nations . [SEP] most portuguese and me ##stic ##os speak one of the african languages and k ##rio ##l as second languages . french is also taught in schools because guinea - bis ##sau is surrounded by french - speaking nations . guinea - bis ##sau is a full member of the franco ##phon ##ie .
streets ' names change [SEP] streets ' names change from west to east ( for instance , east 10th street to west 10th street ) at broadway below 8th street , and at fifth avenue from 8th street and above .
streets ' names change [SEP] streets ' names change from west to east ( for instance , east 10th street to west 10th street ) at broadway below 8th street , and at fifth avenue from 8th street and above .
because it could not easily be reached except through the ottoman empire or neighboring russia [SEP] some regions beyond the ottoman porte were included . one was north africa west of egypt . it was occupied by pi ##ratic ##al kingdoms of the bar ##bar ##y coast , de facto independent since the 18th century . formerly part of the empire at its ap ##oge ##e . iran was included because it could not easily be reached except through the ottoman empire or neighboring russia . in the 1890s the term tended to focus on the conflicts in the balkan states and armenia . the demise of the sick man of europe left considerable confusion as to what was to be meant by " near east " . it is now generally used only in historical contexts , to describe the countries of western asia from the mediterranean to ( or including ) iran . there is , in short , no universally understood fixed inventory of nations , languages or historical assets defined to be in it .
because old persian cu ##ne ##iform had been found there [SEP] the term middle east as a noun and adjective was common in the 19th century in nearly every context except diplomacy and archaeology . an un ##co ##unt ##able number of places appear to have had their middle east ##s from gardens to regions , including the united states . the innovation of the term " near east " to mean the holdings of the ottoman empire as early as the crimean war had left a geographical gap . the east indies , or " far east , " derived ultimately from ptolemy ' s " india beyond the gang ##es . " the ottoman empire ended at the eastern border of iraq . " india this side of the gang ##es " and iran had been omitted . the archaeologists counted iran as " the near east " because old persian cu ##ne ##iform had been found there . this usage did not sit well with the diplomats ; india was left in an e ##qui ##vo ##cal state . they needed a regional term .
their higher bandwidth requirements [SEP] several systems were proposed as the new standard for the us , including the japanese muse system , but all were rejected by the fcc because of their higher bandwidth requirements . at this time , the number of television channels was growing rapidly and bandwidth was already a problem . a new standard had to be more efficient , needing less bandwidth for hd ##tv than the existing nt ##sc .
because of its built in blu - ray disc based player [SEP] sony ' s playstation 3 has extensive hd compatibility because of its built in blu - ray disc based player , so does microsoft ' s xbox 360 with the addition of netflix and windows media center h ##tp ##c streaming capabilities , and the zu ##ne marketplace where users can rent or purchase digital hd content . recently , nintendo released a next generation high definition gaming platform , the wii u , which includes tv remote control features in addition to ip ##tv streaming features like netflix . the hd capabilities of the consoles has influenced some developers to port games from past consoles onto the ps ##3 , xbox 360 and wii u , often with remastered or upscale ##d graphics .
insect attacks [SEP] abnormal disco ##lor ##ation of wood often denotes a disease ##d condition , indicating un ##so ##und ##ness . the black check in western hem ##lock is the result of insect attacks . the reddish - brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds . the disco ##lor ##ation is merely an indication of an injury , and in all probability does not of itself affect the properties of the wood . certain rot - producing fungi imp ##art to wood characteristic colors which thus become sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic of weakness ; however an attractive effect known as spa ##lt ##ing produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic . ordinary sap - stain ##ing is due to fungal growth , but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect .
their sea ##far ##ing tradition [SEP] somali ##s constitute the largest ethnic group in somalia , at approximately 85 % of the nation ' s inhabitants . they are traditionally no ##mad ##s , but since the late 20th century , many have moved to urban areas . while most somali ##s can be found in somalia proper , large numbers also live in ethiopia , dj ##ib ##out ##i , kenya , yemen , the middle east , south asia and europe due to their sea ##far ##ing tradition .
paying for the wars [SEP] strong , royalty - based nation states rose throughout europe in the late middle ages , particularly in england , france , and the christian kingdoms of the iberian peninsula : aragon , castile , and portugal . the long conflicts of the period strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasant ##ry . kings profit ##ed from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled . paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient , and the rate of taxation often increased . the requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the english parliament and the french estates general to gain power and authority .
because they have some distant white ancestry . [SEP] according to dr . carlos moore , resident scholar at brazil ' s university of the state of bahia , in the 21st century afro - multi ##rac ##ials in the arab world , including arabs in north africa , self - identify in ways that resemble multi - racial ##s in latin america . he claims that black - looking arabs , much like black - looking latin americans , consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry .
solely for the purposes of access ##ing affirmative action benefits [SEP] in 2008 , the high court in south africa ruled that chinese south africans who were residents during the apartheid era ( and their descendants ) are to be rec ##lassified as " black people , " solely for the purposes of access ##ing affirmative action benefits , because they were also " disadvantaged " by racial discrimination . chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits .

for them to serve as con ##cu ##bine ##s [SEP] historians estimate that between the advent of islam in 650 ##ce and the abolition of slavery in the arabian peninsula in the mid - 20th century , 10 to 18 million sub - saharan black africans were enslaved by arab slave traders and transported to the arabian peninsula and neighboring countries . this number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the americas . several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st - century arab societies : the traders shipped more female slaves than males , as there was a demand for them to serve as con ##cu ##bine ##s in hare ##ms in the arabian peninsula and neighboring countries . male slaves were cast ##rated in order to serve as hare ##m guards . the death toll of black african slaves from forced labor was high . the mixed - race children of female slaves and arab owners were ass ##imi ##lated into the arab owners ' families under the pat ##ril ##ine ##al kinship system . as a result , few distinctive afro - arab black communities have survived in the arabian peninsula and neighboring countries .
to pursue higher studies [SEP] as african states became independent in the 1960s , the soviet union offered many of their citizens the chance to study in russia . over a period of 40 years , about 400 , 000 african students from various countries moved to russia to pursue higher studies , including many black africans . this extended beyond the soviet union to many countries of the eastern bloc .
the majority of black people in the united states were native - born [SEP] by that time , the majority of black people in the united states were native - born , so the use of the term " african " became problematic . though initially a source of pride , many blacks feared that the use of african as an identity would be a hind ##rance to their fight for full citizenship in the us . they also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating rep ##at ##ria ##ting black people back to africa . in 1835 , black leaders called upon black americans to remove the title of " african " from their institutions and replace it with " negro " or " colored american " . a few institutions chose to keep their historic names , such as the african methodist episcopal church . african americans popularly used the terms " negro " or " colored " for themselves until the late 1960s .

it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by european descendants [SEP] in 1988 , the civil rights leader jesse jackson urged americans to use instead the term " african american " because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by european descendants , such as german american , italian american , etc . since then , african american and black have often had parallel status . however , controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate . ma ##ula ##na karen ##ga argues that the term african - american is more appropriate because it accurately art ##iculate ##s their geographical and historical origin . [ citation needed ] others have argued that " black " is a better term because " african " suggests foreign ##ness , although black americans helped found the united states . still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because african americans have a variety of skin tones . some surveys suggest that the majority of black americans have no preference for " african american " or " black " , although they have a slight preference for " black " in personal settings and " african american " in more formal settings .

clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain [SEP] due to the often political and cultural con ##tour ##s of blackness in the united states , the notion of blackness can also be extended to non - black people . toni morrison once described bill clinton as the first black president of the united states , because , as she put it , he displayed " almost every tr ##ope of blackness " . christopher hitch ##ens was offended by the notion of clinton as the first black president , noting , " mr clinton , according to toni morrison , the nobel prize - winning novelist , is our first black president , the first to come from the broken home , the alcoholic mother , the under - the - bridge shadows of our ranking systems . thus , we may have lost the mystical power to divine dia ##bol ##ism , but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms : broken homes , alcoholic mothers , under - the - bridge habits and ( pre ##sum ##able from the rest of [ arthur ] miller ' s sen ##es ##cent mu ##sing ##s ) the tendency to sexual pre ##dation and to shame ##less per ##ju ##ry about same . " some black activists were also offended , claiming that clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before , while not serving black interests . they cite the lack of action during the rwanda ##n genocide and his welfare reform , which larry roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s . others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration .
trying to escape [SEP] in july 2012 , ancestry . com reported on historic and dna research by its staff that discovered that obama is likely a descendant through his mother of john punch , considered by some historians to be the first african slave in the virginia colony . an ind ##ent ##ured servant , he was " bound for life " in 1640 after trying to escape . the story of him and his descendants is that of multi - racial america since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women , likely ind ##ent ##ured servants and working - class like them . their multi - racial children were free because they were born to free english women . over time , obama ' s line of the bunch family ( as they became known ) were property owners and continued to " marry white " ; they became part of white society , likely by the early to mid - 18th century .

availability of food [SEP] bird migration is the regular seasonal movement , often north and south along a fly ##way , between breeding and winter ##ing grounds . many species of bird migrate . migration carries high costs in pre ##dation and mortality , including from hunting by humans , and is driven primarily by availability of food . it occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere , where birds are funnel ##led on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the mediterranean sea or the caribbean sea .
changes in day length [SEP] the timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length . migrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the sun and stars , the earth ' s magnetic field , and probably also mental maps .
response to changes in food availability , habitat , or weather [SEP] migration is the regular seasonal movement , often north and south , undertaken by many species of birds . bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability , habitat , or weather . sometimes , journeys are not termed " true migration " because they are irregular ( no ##mad ##ism , invasions , ir ##rup ##tions ) or in only one direction ( dispersal , movement of young away from natal area ) . migration is marked by its annual seasonal ##ity . non - migratory birds are said to be resident or se ##dent ##ary . approximately 1800 of the world ' s 10 , 000 bird species are long - distance migrants .
to breed [SEP] many bird populations migrate long distances along a fly ##way . the most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate or arctic summer and returning in the autumn to winter ##ing grounds in warmer regions to the south . of course , in the southern hemisphere the directions are reversed , but there is less land area in the far south to support long - distance migration .
the lack of stop ##over or feeding sites [SEP] often , the migration route of a long - distance mig ##rator bird doesn ' t follow a straight line between breeding and winter ##ing grounds . rather , it could follow an hooked or arched line , with det ##ours around geographical barriers . for most land - birds , such barriers could consist in seas , large water bodies or high mountain ranges , because of the lack of stop ##over or feeding sites , or the lack of thermal columns for broad - winged birds .
lack of thermal columns [SEP] often , the migration route of a long - distance mig ##rator bird doesn ' t follow a straight line between breeding and winter ##ing grounds . rather , it could follow an hooked or arched line , with det ##ours around geographical barriers . for most land - birds , such barriers could consist in seas , large water bodies or high mountain ranges , because of the lack of stop ##over or feeding sites , or the lack of thermal columns for broad - winged birds .
to escape the cold higher ground [SEP] many long - distance migrants appear to be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length . species that move short distances , however , may not need such a timing mechanism , instead moving in response to local weather conditions . thus mountain and moor ##land breeders , such as wall ##cre ##ep ##er ti ##cho ##dro ##ma mu ##rar ##ia and white - throat ##ed dip ##per ci ##nc ##lus ci ##nc ##lus , may move only alt ##it ##udi ##nally to escape the cold higher ground . other species such as merlin fa ##lco col ##umb ##ari ##us and eurasian skylar ##k ala ##uda ar ##ven ##sis move further , to the coast or towards the south . species like the cha ##ffin ##ch are much less migratory in britain than those of continental europe , mostly not moving more than 5 km in their lives .
enhanced breeding opportunities [SEP] species that have no long - distance migratory relatives , such as the wax ##wing ##s bomb ##y ##ci ##lla , are effectively moving in response to winter weather and the loss of their usual winter food , rather than enhanced breeding opportunities .
to obtain more of their preferred foods [SEP] in the tr ##op ##ics there is little variation in the length of day throughout the year , and it is always warm enough for a food supply , but alt ##it ##udi ##nal migration occurs in some tropical birds . there is evidence that this enables the migrants to obtain more of their preferred foods such as fruits .
food becomes scarce [SEP] bird migration is primarily , but not entirely , a northern hemisphere phenomenon . this is because land birds in high northern latitude ##s , where food becomes scarce in winter , leave for areas further south ( including the southern hemisphere ) to over ##win ##ter , and because the continental land ##mas ##s is much larger in the northern hemisphere . in contrast , among ( pe ##lag ##ic ) sea ##birds , species of the southern hemisphere are more likely to migrate . this is because there is a large area of ocean in the southern hemisphere , and more islands suitable for sea ##birds to nest .

males tend to return earlier to the breeding sites [SEP] in poly ##gy ##nous species with considerable sexual dim ##or ##phi ##sm , males tend to return earlier to the breeding sites than their females . this is termed pro ##tan ##dry .
sexual dim ##or ##phi ##sm [SEP] in poly ##gy ##nous species with considerable sexual dim ##or ##phi ##sm , males tend to return earlier to the breeding sites than their females . this is termed pro ##tan ##dry .
they show high site - fidelity [SEP] long distance migrants are believed to disperse as young birds and form attachment ##s to potential breeding sites and to favourite winter ##ing sites . once the site attachment is made they show high site - fidelity , visiting the same winter ##ing sites year after year .
feathers of a bird suffer from wear - and - tear [SEP] birds need to alter their metabolism in order to meet the demands of migration . the storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations . in addition , the feathers of a bird suffer from wear - and - tear and require to be mo ##lt ##ed . the timing of this mo ##lt - usually once a year but sometimes twice - varies with some species mo ##lt ##ing prior to moving to their winter grounds and others mo ##lt ##ing prior to returning to their breeding grounds . apart from physiological adaptations , migration sometimes requires behaviour ##al changes such as flying in flock ##s to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of pre ##dation .
genetic control [SEP] migration in birds is highly lab ##ile and is believed to have developed independently in many av ##ian lineage ##s . while it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control , some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a se ##dent ##ary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all av ##ian lineage ##s . this explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum .
to help hotel owners keep sand out of their lo ##bbies [SEP] the first boardwalk was built in 1870 along a portion of the beach in an effort to help hotel owners keep sand out of their lo ##bbies . businesses were restricted and the boardwalk was removed each year at the end of the peak season . because of its effectiveness and popularity , the boardwalk was expanded in length and width , and modified several times in subsequent years . the historic length of the boardwalk , before the destructive 1944 great atlantic hurricane , was about 7 miles ( 11 km ) and it extended from atlantic city to long ##port , through vent ##nor and mar ##gate .
a radical building boom [SEP] in the early part of the 20th century , atlantic city went through a radical building boom . many of the modest boarding houses that dotted the boardwalk were replaced with large hotels . two of the city ' s most distinctive hotels were the marlborough - b ##len ##heim hotel and the tray ##more hotel .
bradley ' s shop was flooded after a major storm [SEP] in 1883 , salt water ta ##ffy was conceived in atlantic city by david bradley . the traditional story is that bradley ' s shop was flooded after a major storm , soaking his ta ##ffy with salty atlantic ocean water . he sold some " salt water ta ##ffy " to a girl , who proudly walked down to the beach to show her friends . bradley ' s mother was in the back of the store when the sale was made , and loved the name , and so salt water ta ##ffy was born .
to develop a new roadway [SEP] with the redevelopment of las vegas and the opening of two casinos in connecticut in the early 1990s , along with newly built casinos in the nearby philadelphia metro area in the 2000s , atlantic city ' s tourism began to decline due to its failure to divers ##ify away from gaming . determined to expand , in 1999 the atlantic city redevelopment authority partnered with las vegas casino mo ##gul steve wynn to develop a new roadway to a barren section of the city near the marina . nicknamed " the tunnel project " , steve wynn planned the proposed ' mirage atlantic city ' around the idea that he would connect the $ 330 million tunnel stretching 2 . 5 miles ( 4 . 0 km ) from the atlantic city expressway to his new resort . the roadway was later officially named the atlantic city - brig ##ant ##ine connector , and funnel ##s incoming traffic off of the expressway into the city ' s marina district and brig ##ant ##ine , new jersey .
demolished in a dramatic , las vegas styled imp ##los ##ion [SEP] owing to economic conditions and the late 2000s recession , many of the proposed mega casinos never went further than the initial planning stages . one of these developers was pinnacle entertainment , who purchased the sands atlantic city , only to close it permanently november 11 , 2006 . the following year , the resort was demolished in a dramatic , las vegas styled imp ##los ##ion , the first of its kind in atlantic city . while pinnacle entertainment intended to replace it with a $ 1 . 5 – 2 billion casino resort , the company canceled its construction plans and plans to sell the land . the biggest disappointment was when mgm resorts international announced that it would pull out of all development for atlantic city , effectively ending their plans for the mgm grand atlantic city .

the boardwalk that was slated for repairs , prior to the storm [SEP] " super ##storm sandy " struck atlantic city on october 29 , 2012 , causing flooding and power - out ##ages but left minimal damage to any of the tourist areas including the boardwalk and casino resorts , despite widespread belief that the city ' s boardwalk had been destroyed . the source of the mis ##in ##form ##ation was a widely circulated photograph of a damaged section of the boardwalk that was slated for repairs , prior to the storm , and incorrect news reports at the time of the disaster . the storm produced an all - time record low bar ##ometric pressure reading of 94 ##3 mb ( 27 . 85 " ) for not only atlantic city , but the state of new jersey .
winding down and exiting the gaming and hotel business [SEP] executives at trump entertainment resorts , whose sole remaining property will be the trump ta ##j mahal , said in 2013 that they were considering the option of selling the ta ##j and winding down and exiting the gaming and hotel business .
immune reactions play a part in the pathology and clinical features [SEP] clinical im ##mun ##ology is the study of diseases caused by disorders of the immune system ( failure , abe ##rran ##t action , and mali ##gnant growth of the cellular elements of the system ) . it also involves diseases of other systems , where immune reactions play a part in the pathology and clinical features .
both their innate and adaptive im ##mun ##ological responses are greatly suppressed [SEP] the body ’ s capability to react to antigen depends on a person ' s age , antigen type , maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented . neon ##ates are said to be in a state of physiological im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency , because both their innate and adaptive im ##mun ##ological responses are greatly suppressed . once born , a child ’ s immune system responds favorably to protein antigen ##s while not as well to g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s and poly ##sa ##cc ##hari ##des . in fact , many of the infections acquired by neon ##ates are caused by low vi ##ru ##lence organisms like st ##ap ##hyl ##oco ##ccus and pseudo ##mona ##s . in neon ##ates , ops ##onic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited . for example , the mean level of c ##3 in a newborn is approximately 65 % of that found in the adult . ph ##ago ##cy ##tic activity is also greatly impaired in newborn ##s . this is due to lower ops ##onic activity , as well as diminished up - regulation of int ##eg ##rin and select ##in receptors , which limit the ability of ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s to interact with ad ##hesion molecules in the end ##oth ##eli ##um . their mono ##cytes are slow and have a reduced atp production , which also limits the newborn ' s ph ##ago ##cy ##tic activity . although , the number of total l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes is significantly higher than in adults , the cellular and humor ##al immunity is also impaired . antigen - presenting cells in newborn ##s have a reduced capability to activate t cells . also , t cells of a newborn pro ##life ##rate poorly and produce very small amounts of cy ##tok ##ines like il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 12 , and if ##n - g which limits their capacity to activate the humor ##al response as well as the ph ##ago ##cit ##ic activity of macro ##pha ##ge . b cells develop early during ge ##station but are not fully active .
shut down and later sold [SEP] the ease of creating and sharing mp3 ##s resulted in widespread copyright infringement . major record companies argued that this free sharing of music reduced sales , and called it " music piracy " . they reacted by pursuing lawsuits against nap ##ster ( which was eventually shut down and later sold ) and against individual users who engaged in file sharing .
expired [SEP] the basic mp3 deco ##ding and encoding technology is patent - free in the european union , all patents having expired there . in the united states , the technology will be substantially patent - free on 31 december 2017 ( see below ) . the majority of mp3 patents expired in the us between 2007 and 2015 .
the injunction was later reversed [SEP] in september 2006 , german officials seized mp3 players from sand ##isk ' s booth at the if ##a show in berlin after an italian patents firm won an injunction on behalf of sis ##vel against sand ##isk in a dispute over licensing rights . the injunction was later reversed by a berlin judge , but that reversal was in turn blocked the same day by another judge from the same court , " bringing the patent wild west to germany " in the words of one commentator .
early djs creating music in their own homes [SEP] larry heard , a . k . a . " mr . fingers " , claims that the term " house " became popular due to many of the early djs creating music in their own homes using synthesizers and drum machines such as the roland tr - 80 ##8 , tr - 90 ##9 , and the tb 303 . [ citation needed ] these synthesizers were used to create a house sub ##gen ##re called acid house .
differentiate the clubs and djs [SEP] juan atkins , an origin ##ator of detroit techno music , claims the term " house " reflected the exclusive association of particular tracks with particular clubs and djs ; those records helped differentiate the clubs and djs , and thus were considered to be their " house " records . in an effort to maintain such exclusive ##s , the djs were inspired to create their own " house " records .
to add a mass appeal to the music they produce [SEP] in addition to these popular examples of house , there has also been a reunification of contemporary house and its roots . many hip hop and r & b artists also turn to house music to add a mass appeal to the music they produce .
easier to distinguish than lower ##case [SEP] letter case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline . in or ##th ##ography , the upper ##case is primarily reserved for special purposes , such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun , which makes the lower ##case the more common variant in text . in mathematics , letter case may indicate the relationship between objects with upper ##case letters often representing " superior " objects ( e . g . x could be a set containing the generic member x ) . engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper - case letters , which are easier to distinguish than lower ##case , especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small .
epidemic [SEP] in 156 ##2 francisco de ib ##ar ##ra headed a personal expedition in search of the mythical cities of ci ##bola and qui ##vira ; he traveled through the present - day state of chihuahua . francisco de ib ##ar ##ra is thought to have been the first european to see the ruins of pa ##qui ##me . in 156 ##4 rodrigo de rio de lo ##za , a lieutenant under francisco de ib ##ar ##ra , stayed behind after the expedition and found gold at the foot of the mountains of the sierra mad ##re o ##cci ##dent ##al ; he founded the first spanish city in the region , santa barbara in 156 ##7 by bringing 400 european families to the settlement . a few years later in 156 ##9 franciscan missionaries led by fray agustin rodriguez from the coast of sin ##alo ##a and the state of duran ##go founded the first mission in the state in valle de san bart ##olo ##me ( present - day valle de allen ##de ) . fray agustin rodriguez evan ##gel ##ized the native population until 158 ##1 . between 158 ##6 and 158 ##8 a epidemic caused a temporary exodus of the small population in the territory of nueva viz ##ca ##ya .
they differed over their imam ##s ' succession ##s [SEP] within shia islam ( shi ##ism ) , the various sect ##s came into being because they differed over their imam ##s ' succession ##s , just as the shia - sunni separation within islam itself had come into being from the dispute that had arise ##n over the succession to muhammad . each succession dispute brought forth a different tar ##iq ##ah ( literal meaning ' path ' ; extended meaning ' sect ' ) within shia islam . each shia tar ##iq ##ah followed its own particular imam ' s dynasty , thus resulting in different numbers of imam ##s for each particular shia tar ##iq ##ah . when the d ##yna ##stic line of the separating successor imam ended with no heir to succeed him , then either he ( the last imam ) or his un ##born successor was believed to have gone into conceal ##ment , that is , the occult ##ation .
come to an end [SEP] although all these different shia tar ##iq ##ah ##s belong to the shia group ( as opposed to the sunni group ) in islam , there are major doc ##tri ##nal differences between the main shia tar ##iq ##ah ##s . after that there is the complete doc ##tri ##nal break between all the different shia tar ##iq ##ah ##s whose last imam ##s have gone into occult ##ation and the shia ni ##zar ##i ismail ##is who deny the very concept of occult ##ation . the shia ni ##zar ##i ismail ##is by definition have to have a present and living imam until the end of time . [ citation needed ] thus if any living ni ##zar ##i ismail ##i imam fails to leave behind a successor after him then the ni ##zar ##i ismail ##ism ’ s cardinal principle would be broken and it ’ s very rai ##son d ' et ##re would come to an end .
defense jobs [SEP] when world war ii started , ton ##nage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended ; however , the war did provide economic benefits for the city . pet ##ro ##chemical ref ##iner ##ies and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war . ellington field , initially built during world war i , was rev ##ital ##ized as an advanced training center for bombardier ##s and navigator ##s . the brown shipbuilding company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the u . s . navy during world war ii . due to the boom in defense jobs , thousands of new workers migrated to the city , both blacks and whites competing for the higher - paying jobs . president roosevelt had established a policy of non - discrimination for defense contractors , and blacks gained some opportunities , especially in shipbuilding , although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence . economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years .
the nationwide recession [SEP] one wave of the population boom ended abruptly in the mid - 1980s , as oil prices fell pre ##ci ##pit ##ously . the space industry also suffered in 1986 after the space shuttle challenger di ##sin ##te ##grate ##d shortly after launch . there was a cut ##back in some activities for a period . in the late 1980s , the city ' s economy suffered from the nationwide recession . after the early 1990s recession , houston made efforts to divers ##ify its economy by focusing on aerospace and health care / biotechnology , and reduced its dependence on the petroleum industry . since the increase of oil prices in the 2000s , the petroleum industry has again increased its share of the local economy .

it begins to heat excessive ##ly [SEP] the softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conduct ##ivity ( 59 . 6 ##× ##10 ##6 s / m ) and thus also high thermal conduct ##ivity , which are the second highest ( to silver ) among pure metals at room temperature . this is because the resist ##ivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature mostly originates from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice , which are relatively weak for a soft metal . the maximum per ##missible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3 . 1 ##× ##10 ##6 a / m2 of cross - sectional area , above which it begins to heat excessive ##ly . as with other metals , if copper is placed against another metal , gal ##vani ##c corrosion will occur .
floats on top [SEP] the concentration of copper in ore ##s averages only 0 . 6 % , and most commercial ore ##s are sul ##fide ##s , especially cha ##lco ##py ##rite ( cu ##fe ##s ##2 ) and to a lesser extent cha ##lco ##cite ( cu ##2 ##s ) . these minerals are concentrated from crushed ore ##s to the level of 10 – 15 % copper by fr ##oth fl ##ota ##tion or bio ##lea ##ching . heating this material with si ##lica in flash sm ##elt ##ing removes much of the iron as sl ##ag . the process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sul ##fide ##s into its oxide ##s , which in turn react with the si ##lica to form the si ##lica ##te sl ##ag , which floats on top of the heated mass . the resulting copper matt ##e consisting of cu ##2 ##s is then roasted to convert all sul ##fide ##s into oxide ##s :
as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states [SEP] after independence , the chief commissioner ' s province of h . p . came into being on 15 april 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states ( including feudal princes and za ##il ##dar ##s ) in the promo ##nto ##ries of the western him ##ala ##ya , known in full as the sim ##la hills states and four punjab southern hill states by issue of the him ##achal pradesh ( administration ) order , 1948 under sections 3 and 4 of the extra - provincial jurisdiction act , 1947 ( later renamed as the foreign jurisdiction act , 1947 vi ##de a . o . of 1950 ) . the state of bi ##las ##pur was merged in the him ##achal pradesh on 1 april 1954 by the him ##achal pradesh and bi ##las ##pur ( new state ) act , 1954 . him ##achal became a part c state on 26 january 1950 with the implementation of the constitution of india and the lt . governor was appointed . legislative assembly was elected in 1952 . him ##achal pradesh became a union territory on 1 november 1956 . following area of punjab state namely sim ##la , kang ##ra , ku ##lu and la ##hul and spit ##i districts , na ##lag ##ar ##h tehsil of am ##bala district , lo ##hara , am ##b and una kan ##ung ##o circles , some area of santo ##kh ##garh kan ##ung ##o circle and some other specified area of una tehsil of ho ##shi ##ar ##pur district besides some parts of dh ##ar kala ##n kan ##ung ##o circle of path ##an ##kot tehsil of gu ##rda ##sp ##ur district ; were merged with him ##achal pradesh on 1 november 1966 on enactment of punjab reorganisation act , 1966 by the parliament . on 18 december 1970 , the state of him ##achal pradesh act was passed by parliament and the new state came into being on 25 january 1971 . thus him ##achal emerged as the 18th state of the indian union .
to coordinate and organize their growth and development [SEP] fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development such as the formation of marcel ##ia and fruit ##ing bodies . fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of sy ##mb ##iot ##ic interactions , especially with bacteria , un ##ice ##ll ##ular eu ##kar ##yo ##te , plants and insects through bio ##chemical ##s of bio ##tic origin . the bio ##chemical ##s trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner , while if the same chemical molecules are not part of bio ##tic messages , they do not trigger the fungal organism to react . this implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in bio ##tic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation . so far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as fi ##lam ##entation , mating , growth , and pathogen ##ici ##ty . behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non - self , a bio ##tic indicator , bio ##tic message from similar , related , or non - related species , and even filter out " noise " , i . e . similar molecules without bio ##tic content .
it is difficult to develop such a broad range of skills [SEP] companies with limited resources may choose to engage in only a few of these activities , while larger organizations may employ a full spectrum of communications . since it is difficult to develop such a broad range of skills , communications professionals often special ##ize in one or two of these areas but usually have at least a working knowledge of most of them . by far , the most important qualifications communications professionals can possess are excellent writing ability , good ' people ' skills , and the capacity to think critically and strategically .
he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the internet [SEP] in 1988 , only 60 , 000 computers were connected to the internet , and most were main ##frame ##s , mini ##com ##put ##ers and professional works ##tation ##s . on november 2 , 1988 , many started to slow down , because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers – the first internet " computer worm " . the software was traced back to 23 - year - old cornell university graduate student robert tap ##pan morris , jr . who said ' he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the internet ' .
cut off [SEP] orthodox judaism maintains the historical understanding of jewish identity . a jew is someone who was born to a jewish mother , or who converts to judaism in accordance with jewish law and tradition . orthodoxy thus rejects pat ##ril ##ine ##al descent as a means of establishing jewish identity . similarly , orthodoxy strongly condemn ##s inter ##mar ##ria ##ge . inter ##mar ##ria ##ge is seen as a deliberate rejection of judaism , and an inter ##mar ##ried person is effectively cut off from most of the orthodox community . however , some orthodox jewish organizations do reach out to inter ##mar ##ried jews .
philosophical differences [SEP] for guidance in practical application of jewish law , the majority of orthodox jews appeal to the shu ##lch ##an ar ##uch ( " code of jewish law " composed in the 16th century by rabbi joseph car ##o ) together with its surrounding commentaries . thus , at a general level , there is a large degree of uniform ##ity amongst all orthodox jews . concerning the details , however , there is often variance : decisions may be based on various of the standardized codes of jewish law that have been developed over the centuries , as well as on the various res ##pon ##sa . these codes and res ##pon ##sa may differ from each other as regards detail ( and reflecting the above philosophical differences , as regards the weight assigned to these ) . by and large , however , the differences result from the historic dispersal of the jews and the con ##se ##quent development of differences among regions in their practices ( see minh ##ag ) .
their offspring to feed on its decay ##ing corpse [SEP] pre ##dation is a biological interaction where a predator ( a het ##ero ##tro ##ph that is hunting ) feeds on its prey ( the organism that is attacked ) . predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them , but the act of pre ##dation almost always results in the death of the prey . the other main category of consumption is det ##rit ##ivo ##ry , the consumption of dead organic matter . it can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviour ##s , for example , where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decay ##ing corpse . selective pressures imposed on one another has led to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator , resulting in various anti ##pre ##da ##tor adaptations .
the great diversity found in animals [SEP] because of the great diversity found in animals , it is more economical for scientists to study a small number of chosen species so that connections can be drawn from their work and conclusions extra ##pol ##ated about how animals function in general . because they are easy to keep and breed , the fruit fly dr ##oso ##phila mel ##ano ##gas ##ter and the ne ##mat ##ode ca ##eno ##rh ##ab ##dit ##is el ##egan ##s have long been the most intensive ##ly studied meta ##zo ##an model organisms , and were among the first life - forms to be genetically sequence ##d . this was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their genome ##s , but as many genes , intro ##ns , and link ##ages lost , these ec ##dy ##so ##zo ##ans can teach us little about the origins of animals in general . the extent of this type of evolution within the super ##phy ##lum will be revealed by the crust ##ace ##an , anne ##lid , and mo ##llus ##can genome projects currently in progress . analysis of the star ##let sea an ##emon ##e genome has emphasis ##ed the importance of sponge ##s , pl ##aco ##zo ##ans , and cho ##ano ##fl ##age ##lla ##tes , also being sequence ##d , in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to the eu ##met ##az ##oa .

common presence of tr ##och ##op ##hore larvae [SEP] the lo ##ph ##ot ##ro ##cho ##zo ##a , evolved within proto ##sto ##mia , include two of the most successful animal ph ##yla , the mo ##llus ##ca and anne ##lid ##a . the former , which is the second - largest animal ph ##yl ##um by number of described species , includes animals such as snails , cl ##ams , and squid ##s , and the latter comprises the segment ##ed worms , such as earth ##worm ##s and lee ##ches . these two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of tr ##och ##op ##hore larvae , but the anne ##lid ##s were considered closer to the art ##hr ##op ##ods because they are both segment ##ed . now , this is generally considered converge ##nt evolution , owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two ph ##yla . the lo ##ph ##ot ##ro ##cho ##zo ##a also include the ne ##mer ##tea or ribbon worms , the sip ##un ##cula , and several ph ##yla that have a ring of ci ##lia ##ted tentacles around the mouth , called a lo ##ph ##op ##hore . these were traditionally grouped together as the lo ##ph ##op ##hora ##tes . but it now appears that the lo ##ph ##op ##hora ##te group may be para ##phy ##let ##ic , with some closer to the ne ##mer ##tea ##ns and some to the mo ##llus ##cs and anne ##lid ##s . they include the bra ##chio ##pod ##a or lamp shells , which are prominent in the fossil record , the en ##top ##ro ##cta , the ph ##oro ##ni ##da , and possibly the br ##yo ##zo ##a or moss animals .
giving the animal the energy required for motion [SEP] most animals indirectly use the energy of sunlight by eating plants or plant - eating animals . most plants use light to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##tes , fat ##s , proteins and other bio ##mo ##le ##cule ##s , characteristic ##ally containing reduced carbon in the form of carbon - hydrogen bonds . starting with carbon dioxide ( co ##2 ) and water ( h ##2 ##o ) , photos ##yn ##thesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy in the form of simple sugar ##s ( e . g . , glucose ) , with the release of molecular oxygen . these sugar ##s are then used as the building blocks for plant growth , including the production of other bio ##mo ##le ##cule ##s . when an animal eats plants ( or eats other animals which have eaten plants ) , the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal . they are either used directly to help the animal grow , or broken down , releasing stored solar energy , and giving the animal the energy required for motion .
to increase alcohol content [SEP] the alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugar ##s that are produced during fe ##rm ##entation . the quantity of fe ##rm ##ent ##able sugar ##s in the wo ##rt and the variety of yeast used to fe ##rm ##ent the wo ##rt are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer . additional fe ##rm ##ent ##able sugar ##s are sometimes added to increase alcohol content , and enzymes are often added to the wo ##rt for certain styles of beer ( primarily " light " beers ) to convert more complex car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##tes ( star ##ches ) to fe ##rm ##ent ##able sugar ##s . alcohol is a by - product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast ; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12 % by volume . low temperatures and too little fe ##rm ##entation time decreases the effectiveness of yeast ##s and consequently decreases the alcohol content .
yeast [SEP] the basic ingredients of beer are water ; a star ##ch source , such as mal ##ted barley , able to be sac ##cha ##rified ( converted to sugar ##s ) then fe ##rm ##ented ( converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide ) ; a brewer ' s yeast to produce the fe ##rm ##entation ; and a flavour ##ing such as hop ##s . a mixture of star ##ch sources may be used , with a secondary star ##ch source , such as maize ( corn ) , rice or sugar , often being termed an adjunct , especially when used as a lower - cost substitute for mal ##ted barley . less widely used star ##ch sources include mill ##et , so ##rgh ##um and cass ##ava root in africa , and potato in brazil , and ag ##ave in mexico , among others . the amount of each star ##ch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill .
ge ##rmin ##ation [SEP] the star ##ch source in a beer provides the fe ##rm ##ent ##able material and is a key deter ##mina ##nt of the strength and flavour of the beer . the most common star ##ch source used in beer is mal ##ted grain . grain is mal ##ted by soaking it in water , allowing it to begin ge ##rmin ##ation , and then drying the partially ge ##rmin ##ated grain in a ki ##ln . mal ##ting grain produces enzymes that convert star ##ches in the grain into fe ##rm ##ent ##able sugar ##s . different roast ##ing times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of mal ##t from the same grain . darker mal ##ts will produce darker beers .
increased immigration [SEP] for 1890 , the census office changed the design of the population question ##naire . residents were still listed individually , but a new question ##naire sheet was used for each family . additionally , this was the first year that the census distinguished between different east asian races , such as japanese and chinese , due to increased immigration . this census also marked the beginning of the term " race " in the question ##naire ##s . en ##ume ##rator ##s were instructed to write " white , " " black , " " mu ##lat ##to , " " quad ##ro ##on , " " oct ##oro ##on , " " chinese , " " japanese , " or " indian . "
in the united kingdom the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that in germany [SEP] the royal college of chemistry was established by private subscription in 1845 as there was a growing awareness that practical aspects of the experimental sciences were not well taught and that in the united kingdom the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that in germany . as a result of a movement earlier in the decade , many politicians donated funds to establish the college , including benjamin di ##sr ##ael ##i , william gladstone and robert peel . it was also supported by prince albert , who persuaded august wilhelm von ho ##fm ##ann to be the first professor .
annexed by prussia [SEP] in 1837 , the personal union of the united kingdom and hanover ended because william iv ' s heir in the united kingdom was female ( queen victoria ) . hanover could be inherited only by male heirs . thus , hanover passed to william iv ' s brother , ernest augustus , and remained a kingdom until 1866 , when it was annexed by prussia during the austro - prussian war . despite being expected to defeat prussia at the battle of lange ##ns ##al ##za , prussia employed mo ##lt ##ke the elder ' s ke ##ssel ##sch ##la ##cht order of battle to instead destroy the hanover ##ian army . the city of hanover became the capital of the prussian province of hanover . after the annexation , the people of hanover generally opposed the prussian government .
too slow and often imp ##er ##ce ##pt ##ible [SEP] walter bradford cannon agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions , but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain subjective emotional experiences . he argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imp ##er ##ce ##pt ##ible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion . he also believed that the rich ##ness , variety , and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions , that reflected fairly und ##iff ##ere ##nti ##ated fight or flight responses . an example of this theory in action is as follows : an emotion - ev ##oki ##ng event ( snake ) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and a conscious experience of an emotion .
reptiles slept [SEP] the motor centers of reptiles react to sensory cues of vision , sound , touch , chemical , gravity , and motion with pre - set body movements and programmed posture ##s . with the arrival of night - active mammals , smell replaced vision as the dominant sense , and a different way of responding arose from the ol ##factory sense , which is proposed to have developed into mammalian emotion and emotional memory . the mammalian brain invested heavily in ol ##fa ##ction to succeed at night as reptiles slept — one explanation for why ol ##factory lobes in mammalian brains are proportional ##ly larger than in the reptiles . these odor pathways gradually formed the neural blue ##print for what was later to become our limb ##ic brain .
they influence the weight , type , and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched [SEP] the constraints of constructing a flight deck affect the role of a given carrier strongly , as they influence the weight , type , and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched . for example , assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft , especially those loaded with air - to - ground weapons . cat ##ob ##ar is most commonly used on us ##n super ##car ##rier ##s as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full load ##outs , especially on ground - attack missions . st ##ov ##l is used by other na ##vies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for fighter aircraft .
it is cheaper to operate [SEP] the constraints of constructing a flight deck affect the role of a given carrier strongly , as they influence the weight , type , and configuration of the aircraft that may be launched . for example , assisted launch mechanisms are used primarily for heavy aircraft , especially those loaded with air - to - ground weapons . cat ##ob ##ar is most commonly used on us ##n super ##car ##rier ##s as it allows the deployment of heavy jets with full load ##outs , especially on ground - attack missions . st ##ov ##l is used by other na ##vies because it is cheaper to operate and still provides good deployment capability for fighter aircraft .
conventional aircraft cannot dec ##ele ##rate on their own [SEP] on the recovery side of the flight deck , the adaptation to the aircraft load ##out is mirrored . non - vt ##ol or conventional aircraft cannot dec ##ele ##rate on their own , and almost all carriers using them must have arrested - recovery systems ( - bar , e . g . cat ##ob ##ar or st ##ob ##ar ) to recover their aircraft . aircraft that are landing extend a tail ##ho ##ok that catches on arrest ##or wires stretched across the deck to bring themselves to a stop in a short distance . post - wwii royal navy research on safer cat ##ob ##ar recovery eventually led to universal adoption of a landing area angled off axis to allow aircraft who missed the arresting wires to " bolt " and safely return to flight for another landing attempt rather than crashing into aircraft on the forward deck .
would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas [SEP] the disadvantage of the ski - jump is the penalty it exact ##s on aircraft size , payload , and fuel load ( and thus range ) ; heavily laden aircraft can not launch using a ski - jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck , or assistance from a cat ##ap ##ult or ja ##to rocket . for example , the russian su - 33 is only able to launch from the carrier admiral ku ##z ##nets ##ov with a minimal armament and fuel load . another disadvantage is on mixed flight deck operations where helicopters are also present such as a us landing helicopter dock or landing helicopter assault amphibious assault ship a ski jump is not included as this would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas , this flat deck limits the loading of ha ##rrier ##s but is somewhat mit ##igate ##d by the longer rolling start provided by a long flight deck compared to many st ##ov ##l carriers .
on the pre ##text of use as a floating casino [SEP] one st ##ob ##ar carrier : lia ##oning was originally built as the 57 , 000 ton ##ne soviet admiral ku ##z ##nets ##ov - class carrier vary ##ag and was later purchased as a stripped hulk by china in 1998 on the pre ##text of use as a floating casino , then partially rebuilt and towed to china for completion . lia ##oning was commissioned on 25 september 2012 , and began service for testing and training . on 24 or 25 november 2012 , lia ##oning successfully launched and recovered several shen ##yang j - 15 jet fighter aircraft . she is classified as a training ship , intended to allow the navy to practice with carrier usage . on 26 december 2012 , the people ' s daily reported that it will take four to five years for lia ##oning to reach full capacity , mainly due to training and coordination which will take significant amount of time for chinese pl ##a navy to complete as this is the first aircraft carrier in their possession . as it is a training ship , lia ##oning is not assigned to any of china ' s operation fleets .

this is the first aircraft carrier in their possession [SEP] one st ##ob ##ar carrier : lia ##oning was originally built as the 57 , 000 ton ##ne soviet admiral ku ##z ##nets ##ov - class carrier vary ##ag and was later purchased as a stripped hulk by china in 1998 on the pre ##text of use as a floating casino , then partially rebuilt and towed to china for completion . lia ##oning was commissioned on 25 september 2012 , and began service for testing and training . on 24 or 25 november 2012 , lia ##oning successfully launched and recovered several shen ##yang j - 15 jet fighter aircraft . she is classified as a training ship , intended to allow the navy to practice with carrier usage . on 26 december 2012 , the people ' s daily reported that it will take four to five years for lia ##oning to reach full capacity , mainly due to training and coordination which will take significant amount of time for chinese pl ##a navy to complete as this is the first aircraft carrier in their possession . as it is a training ship , lia ##oning is not assigned to any of china ' s operation fleets .
they had higher range and precision [SEP] the aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in world war ii , because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare . the advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range , flexibility and effectiveness of carrier - launched aircraft . they had higher range and precision than naval guns , making them highly effective . the versa ##tility of the carrier was demonstrated in november 1940 when hms illustrious launched a long - range strike on the italian fleet at their base in tara ##nto , signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes . this operation inca ##pac ##itated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers . world war ii in the pacific ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets . the 1941 japanese surprise attack on pearl harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers . concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about , as no other nation had fielded anything comparable . however , the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun - range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of hms glorious by german battleships during the norwegian campaign in 1940 .
washington naval treaty of 1922 [SEP] the development of flat ##top vessels produced the first large fleet ships . in 1918 , hms argus became the world ' s first carrier capable of launching and recovering naval aircraft . as a result of the washington naval treaty of 1922 , which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships , most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down ( or had served ) as different ship types : cargo ships , cruisers , battle ##cr ##uis ##ers , or battleships . these conversions gave rise to the lexington - class aircraft carriers ( 1927 ) , aka ##gi and courageous class . specialist carrier evolution was well underway , with several na ##vies ordering and building warships that were purpose ##fully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid - 1920s , resulting in the commissioning of ships such as ho ##sho ( 1922 ) , hms hermes ( 1924 ) , and bear ##n ( 1927 ) . during world war ii , these ships would become known as fleet carriers .

today ' s aircraft carriers are so expensive [SEP] since world war ii , aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate a steady increase in aircraft size . the large , modern ni ##mit ##z class of us carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the world war ii – era uss enterprise , yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same — a consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of military aircraft over the years . today ' s aircraft carriers are so expensive that nations which operate them risk significant political , economic , and military impact if a carrier is lost , or even used in conflict .
reform of local government [SEP] lancashire is smaller than its historical extent following a major reform of local government . in 1889 , the administrative county of lancashire was created , covering the historical county except for the county boroughs such as blackburn , burnley , barrow - in - fur ##ness , preston , wigan , liverpool and manchester . the area served by the lord - lieutenant ( termed now a ceremonial county ) covered the entirety of the administrative county and the county boroughs , and was expanded whenever boroughs annexed areas in neighbouring counties such as w ##ythe ##ns ##haw ##e in manchester south of the river mer ##sey and historically in cheshire , and southern warrington . it did not cover the western part of tod ##mo ##rden , where the ancient border between lancashire and yorkshire passes through the middle of the town .
increase in sea ##fl ##oor [SEP] sea levels began to rise during the jurassic , which was probably caused by an increase in sea ##fl ##oor spreading . the formation of new crust beneath the surface displaced ocean waters by as much as 200 m ( 65 ##6 ft ) more than today , which flooded coastal areas . furthermore , pang ##aea began to rift into smaller divisions , bringing more land area in contact with the ocean by forming the te ##thy ##s sea . temperatures continued to increase and began to stabilize . humidity also increased with the proximity of water , and deserts retreated .
sea levels rose [SEP] the late jurassic spans from 163 million to 145 million years ago . the late jurassic featured a massive extinction of sa ##uro ##pods and ich ##thy ##osa ##urs due to the separation of pang ##aea into laura ##sia and go ##nd ##wana in an extinction known as the jurassic - cretaceous extinction . sea levels rose , destroying fern prairie ##s and creating shallow ##s in its wake . ich ##thy ##osa ##urs went extinct whereas sa ##uro ##pods , as a whole , did not die out in the jurassic ; in fact , some species , like the titan ##osaurus , lived up to the k - t extinction . the increase in sea - levels opened up the atlantic sea way which would continue to get larger over time . the divided world would give opportunity for the divers ##ification of new dinosaurs .
they don ' t have to be relay ##ed through a central point [SEP] some systems are capable of multi ##point con ##fer ##en ##cing with no mc ##u , stand - alone , embedded or otherwise . these use a standards - based h . 323 technique known as " decent ##ral ##ized multi ##point " , where each station in a multi ##point call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central " manager " or other bottle ##neck . the advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they don ' t have to be relay ##ed through a central point . also , users can make ad - hoc multi ##point calls without any concern for the availability or control of an mc ##u . this added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth , because every station must transmit to every other station directly .
delay in communication [SEP] philip ii of spain decreed the change from the julian to the gregorian calendar , which affected much of roman catholic europe , as philip was at the time ruler over spain and portugal as well as much of italy . in these territories , as well as in the polish – lithuanian commonwealth ( ruled by anna ja ##gie ##llon ) and in the papal states , the new calendar was implemented on the date specified by the bull , with julian thursday , 4 october 158 ##2 , being followed by gregorian friday , 15 october 158 ##2 . the spanish and portuguese colonies followed somewhat later de facto because of delay in communication .
language - independent [SEP] a language - independent alternative used in many countries is to hold up one ' s two fists with the index kn ##uck ##le of the left hand against the index kn ##uck ##le of the right hand . then , starting with january from the little kn ##uck ##le of the left hand , count kn ##uck ##le , space , kn ##uck ##le , space through the months . a kn ##uck ##le represents a month of 31 days , and a space represents a short month ( a 28 - or 29 - day february or any 30 - day month ) . the junction between the hands is not counted , so the two index knuckles represent july and august .
irregularities [SEP] in conjunction with the system of months there is a system of weeks . a physical or electronic calendar provides conversion from a given date to the weekday , and shows multiple dates for a given weekday and month . calculating the day of the week is not very simple , because of the irregularities in the gregorian system . when the gregorian calendar was adopted by each country , the weekly cycle continued un ##int ##er ##rup ##ted . for example , in the case of the few countries that adopted the reformed calendar on the date proposed by gregory xiii for the calendar ' s adoption , friday , 15 october 158 ##2 , the preceding date was thursday , 4 october 158 ##2 ( julian calendar ) .
the difficulties of programming for the ps ##3 [SEP] the xbox 360 ' s advantage over its competitors was due to the release of high profile titles from both first party and third party developers . the 2007 game critics awards honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins – more than any other platform . by march 2008 , the xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7 . 5 games per console in the us ; the rate was 7 . 0 in europe , while its competitors were 3 . 8 ( ps ##3 ) and 3 . 5 ( wii ) , according to microsoft . at the 2008 game developers conference , microsoft announced that it expected over 1 , 000 games available for xbox 360 by the end of the year . as well as enjoying exclusive ##s such as additions to the halo franchise and gears of war , the xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles that were initially planned to be ps ##3 exclusive ##s , including devil may cry , ace combat , vi ##rt ##ua fighter , grand theft auto iv , final fantasy xiii , te ##kken 6 , metal gear solid : rising , and l . a . noir ##e . in addition , xbox 360 versions of cross - platform games were generally considered superior to their ps ##3 counterparts in 2006 and 2007 , due in part to the difficulties of programming for the ps ##3 .
it strengthened microsoft as a major force in the console market [SEP] the xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor , and although not the best - selling console of the seventh - generation , it is regarded as a success since it strengthened microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well - established rivals . the inexpensive nintendo wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third - party software support in its later years , and it has been viewed by some as a fa ##d since the succeeding wii u had a poor debut in 2012 . the playstation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles , making it far less dominant than its predecessor , the playstation 2 , and it took until late in the playstation 3 ' s lifespan for its sales and game titles to reach par ##ity with the xbox 360 . tech ##rada ##r proclaimed that " xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill – a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor , xbox one " .
it would create a power vacuum and des ##ta ##bil ##ize the region [SEP] after just 100 hours of ground combat , and with all of kuwait and much of southern iraq under coalition control , us president george h . w . bush ordered a cease - fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for ce ##ssa ##tion of hostilities . some us politicians were disappointed by this move , believing bush should have pressed on to baghdad and removed hussein from power ; there is little doubt that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired . still , the political ram ##ification ##s of removing hussein would have broad ##ened the scope of the conflict greatly , and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action , believing it would create a power vacuum and des ##ta ##bil ##ize the region .
a traditional distrust of standing armies [SEP] following the american revolutionary war , the united states faced potential military conflict on the high seas as well as on the western frontier . the united states was a minor military power during this time , having only a modest army , marine corps , and navy . a traditional distrust of standing armies , combined with faith in the abilities of local militia , pre ##cl ##uded the development of well - trained units and a professional officer corps . jefferson ##ian leaders preferred a small army and navy , fearing that a large military establishment would involve the united states in excessive foreign wars , and potentially allow a domestic tyrant to seize power .
population expansion , railroad construction , and the disappearance of the buffalo herds [SEP] after the civil war , population expansion , railroad construction , and the disappearance of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on the great plains . several tribes , especially the sioux and coma ##nche , fiercely resisted confinement to reservations . the main role of the army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their wars against settlers and each other , william te ##cum ##se ##h sherman and philip sheridan were in charge . a famous victory for the plains nations was the battle of the little big horn in 1876 , when col . george armstrong custer and two hundred plus members of the 7th cavalry were killed by a force consisting of native americans from the la ##kota , northern cheyenne , and ara ##pa ##ho nations . the last significant conflict came in 1891 .
it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency [SEP] infrared vibration ##al spectroscopy ( see also near - infrared spectroscopy ) is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds . each chemical bond in a molecule vi ##brates at a frequency characteristic of that bond . a group of atoms in a molecule ( e . g . , ch ##2 ) may have multiple modes of os ##ci ##llation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole . if an os ##ci ##llation leads to a change in dip ##ole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency . the vibration ##al frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light . typically , the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000 – 400 cm ##−1 , the mid - infrared . a spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded . this can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity ( for example , a wet sample will show a broad o - h absorption around 320 ##0 cm ##−1 ) .
increases [SEP] the ##rm ##ographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum ( roughly 900 – 14 , 000 nano ##meter ##s or 0 . 9 – 14 μ ##m ) and produce images of that radiation . since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures , according to the black body radiation law , the ##rm ##ography makes it possible to " see " one ' s environment with or without visible illumination . the amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature , therefore the ##rm ##ography allows one to see variations in temperature ( hence the name ) .
ir does not penetrate walls [SEP] ir data transmission is also employed in short - range communication among computer peripheral ##s and personal digital assistants . these devices usually conform to standards published by ir ##da , the infrared data association . remote controls and ir ##da devices use infrared light - emi ##tting di ##odes ( led ##s ) to emi ##t infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam . the beam is mod ##ulated , i . e . switched on and off , to en ##code the data . the receiver uses a silicon photo ##dio ##de to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current . it responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter , and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light . infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density . ir does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms . infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances . infrared remote control protocols like rc - 5 , sir ##c , are used to communicate with infrared .
if any one type is removed from the system [SEP] a 2007 study conducted by the national science foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are code ##pen ##dent — that diversity among species requires diversity within a species , and vice versa . " if any one type is removed from the system , the cycle can break down , and the community becomes dominated by a single species . " at present , the most threatened ecosystems are found in fresh water , according to the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 , which was confirmed by the " freshwater animal diversity assessment " , organised by the biodiversity platform , and the french institut de rec ##her ##che pour le develop ##pe ##ment ( mn ##hn ##p ) .
either a numerical and / or fitness advantage of an introduced species [SEP] endemic species can be threatened with extinction through the process of genetic pollution , i . e . un ##con ##tro ##lled hybrid ##ization , intro ##gre ##ssion and genetic swamp ##ing . genetic pollution leads to homo ##gen ##ization or replacement of local genome ##s as a result of either a numerical and / or fitness advantage of an introduced species . hybrid ##ization and intro ##gre ##ssion are side - effects of introduction and invasion . these phenomena can be especially detrimental to rare species that come into contact with more abundant ones . the abundant species can inter ##bre ##ed with the rare species , swamp ##ing its gene pool . this problem is not always apparent from morphological ( outward appearance ) observations alone . some degree of gene flow is normal adaptation , and not all gene and gen ##otype constellation ##s can be preserved . however , hybrid ##ization with or without intro ##gre ##ssion may , nevertheless , threaten a rare species ' existence .
how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent geologic sections . [SEP] the fossil record suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in history . however , not all scientists support this view , since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent geologic sections . some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts , modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago . , whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the divers ##ification of life . estimates of the present global macro ##scopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million , with a best estimate of somewhere near 9 million , the vast majority art ##hr ##op ##ods . diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection .
rainforest collapse led to a great loss of plant and animal life . [SEP] since life began on earth , five major mass extinction ##s and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity . the ph ##ane ##ro ##zo ##ic e ##on ( the last 540 million years ) marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the cambrian explosion — a period during which the majority of multi ##cellular ph ##yla first appeared . the next 400 million years included repeated , massive biodiversity losses classified as mass extinction events . in the carbon ##iferous , rainforest collapse led to a great loss of plant and animal life . the per ##mian – triassic extinction event , 251 million years ago , was the worst ; ve ##rte ##brate recovery took 30 million years . the most recent , the cretaceous – pale ##ogen ##e extinction event , occurred 65 million years ago and has often attracted more attention than others because it resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs .
formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion [SEP] in agriculture and animal husband ##ry , the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybrid ##ization to increase yield . often hybrid ##ized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybrid ##ized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases . local governments and industry have been pushing hybrid ##ization . formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution . this has resulted in loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole .
for ease of identification [SEP] the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together , and all graphic codes were together , for ease of identification . the first two columns ( 32 positions ) were reserved for control characters . : 220 , 236 § 8 , 9 ) the " space " character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier , so it became position 20 ##he ##x ; : 237 § 10 for the same reason , many special signs commonly used as sep ##arat ##ors were placed before digits . the committee decided it was important to support upper ##case 64 - character alphabet ##s , and chose to pattern as ##ci ##i so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64 - character set of graphic codes , : 228 , 237 § 14 as was done in the dec six ##bit code . lower ##case letters were therefore not inter ##lea ##ved with upper ##case . to keep options available for lower ##case letters and other graphics , the special and nu ##meric codes were arranged before the letters , and the letter a was placed in position 41 ##he ##x to match the draft of the corresponding british standard . : 238 § 18 the digits 0 – 9 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefix ##ed with 01 ##1 , making conversion with binary - coded decimal straightforward .
control - q [SEP] when a tel ##ety ##pe 33 as ##r equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control - s ( x ##off , an abbreviation for transmit off ) , it caused the tape reader to stop ; receiving control - q ( x ##on , " transmit on " ) caused the tape reader to resume . this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a " hands ##hak ##ing " signal warning a send ##er to stop transmission because of impending over ##flow ; it persist ##s to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique . on some systems control - s retains its meaning but control - q is replaced by a second control - s to resume output . the 33 as ##r also could be configured to employ control - r ( dc ##2 ) and control - t ( dc ##4 ) to start and stop the tape punch ; on some units equipped with this function , the corresponding control character lettering on the key ##cap above the letter was tape and tape respectively .
their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compiler ##s [SEP] c tri ##graphs were created to solve this problem for an ##si c , although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compiler ##s limited their use . many programmers kept their computers on us - as ##ci ##i , so plain - text in swedish , german etc . ( for example , in e - mail or use ##net ) contained " { , } " and similar variants in the middle of words , something those programmers got used to . for example , a swedish programmer mail ##ing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch , could get " n { ja ##g ha ##r sm | r ##g } sar . " as the answer , which should be " na ja ##g ha ##r sm ##org ##asa ##r . " meaning " no i ' ve got sandwiches . "
so that connections between hosts with different line - ending conventions and character sets could be supported [SEP] computers attached to the ar ##pan ##et included machines running operating systems such as tops - 10 and ten ##ex using cr - l ##f line endings , machines running operating systems such as multi ##cs using l ##f line endings , and machines running operating systems such as os / 360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used e ##bc ##dic rather than as ##ci ##i . the tel ##net protocol defined an as ##ci ##i " network virtual terminal " ( n ##v ##t ) , so that connections between hosts with different line - ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network . tel ##net used as ##ci ##i along with cr - l ##f line endings , and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the n ##v ##t . the file transfer protocol adopted the tel ##net protocol , including use of the network virtual terminal , for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default as ##ci ##i mode . this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols , and to other network protocols , such as those used for e - mail and the world wide web , on systems not using the n ##v ##t ' s cr - l ##f line - ending convention .
would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six - bit code [SEP] the committee debated the possibility of a shift function ( like in it ##a ##2 ) , which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six - bit code . in a shifted code , some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes . it allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission un ##rea ##dable . the standards committee decided against shifting , and so as ##ci ##i required at least a seven - bit code . : 215 , 236 § 4

eight bits ( oct ##ets ) would allow two four - bit patterns to efficiently en ##code two digits with binary - coded decimal [SEP] the committee considered an eight - bit code , since eight bits ( oct ##ets ) would allow two four - bit patterns to efficiently en ##code two digits with binary - coded decimal . however , it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could su ##ffi ##ce . the committee voted to use a seven - bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission . since per ##for ##ated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position , it also allowed for a par ##ity bit for error checking if desired . : 217 , 236 § 5 eight - bit machines ( with oct ##ets as the native data type ) that did not use par ##ity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0 .

as ##ci ##i suited the needs of only the usa and a few other countries [SEP] other international standards bodies have ratified character encoding ##s such as iso / iec 64 ##6 that are identical or nearly identical to as ##ci ##i , with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states , such as the symbol for the united kingdom ' s pound sterling ( £ ) . almost every country needed an adapted version of as ##ci ##i , since as ##ci ##i suited the needs of only the usa and a few other countries . for example , canada had its own version that supported french characters . other adapted encoding ##s include is ##ci ##i ( india ) , vis ##ci ##i ( vietnam ) , and yu ##sc ##ii ( yugoslavia ) . although these encoding ##s are sometimes referred to as as ##ci ##i , true as ##ci ##i is defined strictly only by the an ##si standard .
true as ##ci ##i is defined strictly only by the an ##si standard [SEP] other international standards bodies have ratified character encoding ##s such as iso / iec 64 ##6 that are identical or nearly identical to as ##ci ##i , with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states , such as the symbol for the united kingdom ' s pound sterling ( £ ) . almost every country needed an adapted version of as ##ci ##i , since as ##ci ##i suited the needs of only the usa and a few other countries . for example , canada had its own version that supported french characters . other adapted encoding ##s include is ##ci ##i ( india ) , vis ##ci ##i ( vietnam ) , and yu ##sc ##ii ( yugoslavia ) . although these encoding ##s are sometimes referred to as as ##ci ##i , true as ##ci ##i is defined strictly only by the an ##si standard .
less costly and in some ways less fragile [SEP] probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the tel ##ety ##pe model 33 as ##r , which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader / punch option . paper tape was a very popular medium for long - term program storage until the 1980s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape . in particular , the tel ##ety ##pe model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 ( control - q , dc ##1 , also known as x ##on ) , 19 ( control - s , dc ##3 , also known as x ##off ) , and 127 ( del ##ete ) became de facto standards . the model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control - g ( bel , meaning audi ##bly alert the operator ) literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character . because the key ##top for the o key also showed a left - arrow symbol ( from as ##ci ##i - 1963 , which had this character instead of under ##sco ##re ) , a non ##com ##pl ##ian ##t use of code 15 ( control - o , shift in ) interpreted as " del ##ete previous character " was also adopted by many early times ##hari ##ng systems but eventually became neglected .
the inherent ambiguity of many control characters , combined with their historical usage [SEP] the inherent ambiguity of many control characters , combined with their historical usage , created problems when transferring " plain text " files between systems . the best example of this is the new ##line problem on various operating systems . tel ##ety ##pe machines required that a line of text be terminated with both " carriage return " ( which moves the print ##head to the beginning of the line ) and " line feed " ( which advances the paper one line without moving the print ##head ) . the name " carriage return " comes from the fact that on a manual type ##writer the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the type ##bar ##s struck the ribbon remained stationary . the entire carriage had to be pushed ( returned ) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line .
to make it an ignored character [SEP] code 127 is officially named " del ##ete " but the tel ##ety ##pe label was " rub ##out " . since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes , interpretations of this code varied . the original tel ##ety ##pe meaning , and the intent of the standard , was to make it an ignored character , the same as nu ##l ( all zero ##es ) . this was useful specifically for paper tape , because punching the all - ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would ob ##lite ##rate it . tapes designed to be " hand edited " could even be produced with spaces of extra nu ##ls ( blank tape ) so that a block of characters could be " rubbed out " and then replacements put into the empty space .
introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone [SEP] unfortunately , requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone . to sim ##plify matters plain text data streams , including files , on multi ##cs used line feed ( l ##f ) alone as a line term ##inator . unix and unix - like systems , and amiga systems , adopted this convention from multi ##cs . the original macintosh os , apple dos , and pro ##dos , on the other hand , used carriage return ( cr ) alone as a line term ##inator ; however , since apple replaced these operating systems with the unix - based os x operating system , they now use line feed ( l ##f ) as well .
extract more nutrition [SEP] other animals , such as rabbits and rodents , pr ##act ##ise cop ##rop ##ha ##gia behaviour ##s - eating specialised fae ##ces in order to re - digest food , especially in the case of rough ##age . cap ##y ##bara , rabbits , ham ##sters and other related species do not have a complex digest ##ive system as do , for example , rum ##ina ##nts . instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut . soft fae ##cal pe ##llet ##s of partially digest ##ed food are ex ##cre ##ted and generally consumed immediately . they also produce normal dropping ##s , which are not eaten .
ex ##cre ##ted and generally consumed immediately [SEP] other animals , such as rabbits and rodents , pr ##act ##ise cop ##rop ##ha ##gia behaviour ##s - eating specialised fae ##ces in order to re - digest food , especially in the case of rough ##age . cap ##y ##bara , rabbits , ham ##sters and other related species do not have a complex digest ##ive system as do , for example , rum ##ina ##nts . instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut . soft fae ##cal pe ##llet ##s of partially digest ##ed food are ex ##cre ##ted and generally consumed immediately . they also produce normal dropping ##s , which are not eaten .
more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled [SEP] digest ##ive systems take many forms . there is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digest ##ion . external digest ##ion developed earlier in evolutionary history , and most fungi still rely on it . in this process , enzymes are secret ##ed into the environment surrounding the organism , where they break down an organic material , and some of the products diffuse back to the organism . animals have a tube ( gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract ) in which internal digest ##ion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled .
end [SEP] the nitrogen fixing r ##hi ##zo ##bia are an interesting case , wherein con ##ju ##gative elements naturally engage in inter - kingdom con ##ju ##gation . such elements as the ag ##ro ##ba ##cter ##ium ti or ri pl ##as ##mi ##ds contain elements that can transfer to plant cells . transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of op ##ines , which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources . infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors . the ti and ri pl ##as ##mi ##ds are thus end ##os ##ym ##bio ##nts of the bacteria , which are in turn end ##os ##ym ##bio ##nts ( or parasites ) of the infected plant .
our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed , so we stop trying . [SEP] teeth ( singular tooth ) are small whitish structures found in the jaws ( or mouths ) of many ve ##rte ##brates that are used to tear , scrape , milk and chew food . teeth are not made of bone , but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness , such as enamel , dent ##ine and cement ##um . human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables prop ##rio ##ception . this is the ability of sensation when chewing , for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth , such as a chip ##ped plate mixed in food , our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed , so we stop trying .
the digest ##ion and absorption of nutrients occurs [SEP] the ab ##oma ##sum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in rum ##ina ##nts . it is a close equivalent of a mono ##gas ##tric stomach ( e . g . , those in humans or pigs ) , and digest ##a is processed here in much the same way . it serves primarily as a site for acid hydro ##lysis of micro ##bial and dietary protein , preparing these protein sources for further digest ##ion and absorption in the small int ##est ##ine . digest ##a is finally moved into the small int ##est ##ine , where the digest ##ion and absorption of nutrients occurs . micro ##bes produced in the re ##tic ##ulo - rum ##en are also digest ##ed in the small int ##est ##ine .
produces hormones that stimulate the release of pan ##cre ##atic lip ##ase from the pan ##cre ##as and bile from the liver [SEP] digest ##ion of some fat ##s can begin in the mouth where ling ##ual lip ##ase breaks down some short chain lip ##ids into dig ##ly ##cer ##ides . however fat ##s are mainly digest ##ed in the small int ##est ##ine . the presence of fat in the small int ##est ##ine produces hormones that stimulate the release of pan ##cre ##atic lip ##ase from the pan ##cre ##as and bile from the liver which helps in the em ##uls ##ification of fat ##s for absorption of fatty acids . complete digest ##ion of one molecule of fat ( a tri ##gly ##cer ##ide ) results a mixture of fatty acids , mono - and di - g ##ly ##cer ##ides , as well as some und ##ige ##sted tri ##gly ##cer ##ides , but no free g ##ly ##cer ##ol molecules .
several proteins form a contiguous channel travers ##ing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria [SEP] in a channel trans ##up ##port system , several proteins form a contiguous channel travers ##ing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria . it is a simple system , which consists of only three protein subunit ##s : the abc protein , membrane fusion protein ( m ##fp ) , and outer membrane protein ( om ##p ) [ specify ] . this secret ##ion system transports various molecules , from ions , drugs , to proteins of various sizes ( 20 - 900 k ##da ) . the molecules secret ##ed vary in size from the small es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli peptide coli ##cin v , ( 10 k ##da ) to the pseudo ##mona ##s flu ##ores ##cens cell ad ##hesion protein lap ##a of 900 k ##da .
, forming spherical structures made of a lip ##id bi ##layer en ##cl ##osing per ##ip ##las ##mic materials [SEP] in addition to the use of the multi ##pro ##tein complexes listed above , gram - negative bacteria possess another method for release of material : the formation of outer membrane ve ##sic ##les . portions of the outer membrane pinch off , forming spherical structures made of a lip ##id bi ##layer en ##cl ##osing per ##ip ##las ##mic materials . ve ##sic ##les from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain vi ##ru ##lence factors , some have im ##mun ##omo ##du ##lat ##ory effects , and some can directly adhere to and into ##xi ##cate host cells . while release of ve ##sic ##les has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions , the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective .
the stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemical ##ly through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes [SEP] in mammals , preparation for digest ##ion begins with the ce ##pha ##lic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digest ##ive enzymes are produced in the stomach . mechanical and chemical digest ##ion begin in the mouth where food is chewed , and mixed with saliva to begin en ##zy ##matic processing of star ##ches . the stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemical ##ly through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes . absorption occurs in the stomach and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract , and the process finishes with def ##eca ##tion .
body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger ' [SEP] aesthetic group gymnastics ( ag ##g ) was developed from the finnish " na ##is ##vo ##imi ##ste ##lu " . it differs from rhythmic gymnastics in that body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger ' athletes do not use apparatus in international ag ##g competitions compared to rhythmic gymnastics where ball , ribbon , hoop and clubs are used on the floor area . the sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility , balance , speed , strength , coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow , expression and aesthetic appeal . a good performance is characterized by uniform ##ity and sim ##ult ##ane ##ity . the competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements , such as body waves , swings , balance ##s , pi ##vot ##s , jumps and leaps , dance steps , and lifts . the international federation of aesthetic group gymnastics ( if ##ag ##g ) was established in 2003 .
because athletes in ancient times exercised and competed without clothing [SEP] the word gymnastics derives from the common greek adjective γ ##υ ##μ ##ν ##ος ( gym ##nos ) meaning " naked " , by way of the related verb γ ##υ ##μ ##ν ##α ##ζ ##ω ( gym ##na ##zo ) , whose meaning is to train naked " , " train in gymnast ##ic exercise " , generally " to train , to exercise " . the verb had this meaning , because athletes in ancient times exercised and competed without clothing . it came into use in the 1570 ##s , from latin gymnast ##icus , from greek gymnast ##iko ##s " fond of or skilled in bodily exercise , " from gym ##na ##ze ##in " to exercise or train " ( see gymnasium ) .
the bars were prone to breaking , [SEP] on the uneven bars , the gymnast performs a routine on two horizontal bars set at different heights . these bars are made of fiber ##glass covered in wood lam ##inate , to prevent them from breaking . in the past , bars were made of wood , but the bars were prone to breaking , providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies . the width and height of the bars may be adjusted . in the past , the uneven parallel bars were closer together . they ' ve been moved increasingly further apart , allowing gymnast ##s to perform swinging , circling , transitional , and release moves , that may pass over , under , and between the two bars . at the elite level , movements must pass through the hands ##tan ##d . gymnast ##s often mount the uneven bars using a spring ##board , or a small mat . chalk and grips ( a leather strip with holes for fingers to protect hands and improve performance ) may be used while doing this event . the chalk helps take the moisture out of gymnast ' s hands to decrease friction and prevent rip ##s ( tears to the skin of the hands ) , dow ##el grips help gymnast ##s grip the bar .
" und ##is ##ci ##plin ##ed " catalan ##ism [SEP] on 16 march 1938 , barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the italian air force , causing more than 3 , 000 deaths , with one of the bombs hitting the club ' s offices . a few months later , catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the " und ##is ##ci ##plin ##ed " catalan ##ism , the club , now down to just 3 , 48 ##6 members , faced a number of restrictions . all signs of regional nationalism , including language , flag and other signs of sep ##arat ##ism were banned throughout spain . the catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non - spanish names . these measures forced the club to change its name to club de fu ##t ##bol barcelona and to remove the catalan flag from its crest .
penalties [SEP] in june 1982 , diego mara ##don ##a was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from boca juniors . in the following season , under coach luis , barcelona won the copa del rey , beating real madrid . however , mara ##don ##a ' s time with barcelona was short - lived and he soon left for napoli . at the start of the 1984 – 85 season , terry ve ##nable ##s was hired as manager and he won la liga with noteworthy displays by german midfielder bern ##d schuster . the next season , he took the team to their second european cup final , only to lose on penalties to ste ##au ##a bu ##cure ##sti during a dramatic evening in seville .
stable income [SEP] fc barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups , competing in the camp ##ion ##at de cat ##al ##un ##ya and the copa del rey . in 1902 , the club won its first trophy , the copa mac ##aya , and participated in the first copa del rey , losing 1 – 2 to bi ##z ##ca ##ya in the final . hans ga ##mp ##er — now known as joan ga ##mp ##er — became club president in 1908 , finding the club in financial difficulty after not winning a competition since the camp ##ion ##at de cat ##al ##un ##ya in 1905 . club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925 , he spent 25 years in total at the helm . one of his main achievements was ensuring bar ##ca acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income .
dictatorship ##s [SEP] during the dictatorship ##s of miguel pri ##mo de rivera ( 1923 – 1930 ) and especially of francisco franco ( 1939 – 1975 ) , all regional cultures were suppressed . all of the languages spoken in spanish territory , except spanish ( cast ##ilia ##n ) itself , were officially banned . symbol ##ising the catalan people ' s desire for freedom , bar ##ca became ' more than a club ' ( me ##s que un club ) for the catalan ##s . according to manuel va ##zquez mont ##al ##ban , the best way for the catalan ##s to demonstrate their identity was by joining bar ##ca . it was less risky than joining a clandestine anti - franco movement , and allowed them to express their di ##ssi ##den ##ce . during franco ' s regime , however , the b ##lau ##gra ##na team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level , even giving two awards to him .
meet uefa criteria [SEP] in 1980 , when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet uefa criteria , the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to ins ##cr ##ibe their name on the bricks for a small fee . the idea was popular with supporters , and thousands of people paid the fee . later this became the centre of controversy when media in madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long - time real madrid chairman and franco supporter santiago bern ##abe ##u . in preparation for the 1992 summer olympics two tier ##s of seating were installed above the previous roof ##line . it has a current capacity of 99 , 354 making it the largest stadium in europe .
ban from all football [SEP] two days later , it was announced that luis enrique would return to barcelona as head coach , after he agreed to a two - year deal . he was recommended by sporting director and ##oni zu ##bi ##zar ##ret ##a , his former national teammate . following enrique ' s arrival , barcelona broke their transfer record when they paid liverpool f . c . between € ##8 ##1 to € ##9 ##4 million for striker luis suarez , who was serving a four - month ban from all football - related activity imposed by the fifa disciplinary committee after biting italian defender giorgio chi ##elli ##ni during his appearance for uruguay in a world cup group stage match .
coordination with foreign security services [SEP] despite its domestic focus , the fbi also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 legal attache ( leg ##at ) offices and 15 sub - offices in u . s . em ##bas ##sies and consulate ##s across the globe . these overseas offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct un ##ila ##tera ##l operations in the host countries . the fbi can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the cia has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies .
national research council [SEP] for over 40 years , the fbi crime lab in quan ##tic ##o believed lead in bullets had unique chemical signatures . it analyzed the bullets with the goal of matching them chemical ##ly , not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory , but also to a single box of bullets . the national academy of sciences conducted an 18 - month independent review of comparative bullet - lead analysis . in 2003 , its national research council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of fbi testimony . it found the analytic model used by the fbi for interpreting results was deeply flawed , and the conclusion , that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition , was so overs ##tated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence . one year later , the fbi decided to stop doing bullet lead analysis .
assumed directly into heaven [SEP] the gospel of luke begins its account of mary ' s life with the ann ##unciation , when the angel gabriel appeared to her and announced her divine selection to be the mother of jesus . according to gospel accounts , mary was present at the cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion of jesus and is depicted as a member of the early christian community in jerusalem . according to ap ##oc ##ry ##pha ##l writings , at some time soon after her death , her inc ##or ##rup ##t body was assumed directly into heaven , to be reunited with her soul , and the apostles there ##up ##on found the tomb empty ; this is known in christian teaching as the assumption .
demolished or subdivided [SEP] height limits in the melbourne cb ##d were lifted in 1958 , after the construction of ic ##i house , transforming the city ' s skyline with the introduction of skyscraper ##s . suburban expansion then intensified , serviced by new indoor malls beginning with chad ##stone shopping centre . the post - war period also saw a major renewal of the cb ##d and st kilda road which significantly modern ##ised the city . new fire regulations and redevelopment saw most of the taller pre - war cb ##d buildings either demolished or partially retained through a policy of fa ##ca ##dis ##m . many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era were also either demolished or subdivided .
fears that beaches and marine wildlife could be affected [SEP] another recent environmental issue in melbourne was the victorian government project of channel deep ##ening melbourne ports by dr ##edging port phillip bay — the port phillip channel deep ##ening project . it was subject to controversy and strict regulations among fears that beaches and marine wildlife could be affected by the disturbance of heavy metals and other industrial sediments . other major pollution problems in melbourne include levels of bacteria including e . coli in the ya ##rra river and its tributaries caused by sept ##ic systems , as well as litter . up to 350 , 000 cigarette butt ##s enter the storm water runoff every day . several programs are being implemented to mini ##mise beach and river pollution . in february 2010 , the transition decade , an initiative to transition human society , economics and environment towards sustainability , was launched in melbourne .

addressing and postal purposes [SEP] melbourne is often referred to as australia ' s garden city , and the state of victoria was once known as the garden state . there is an abundance of parks and gardens in melbourne , many close to the cb ##d with a variety of common and rare plant species amid landscape ##d vista ##s , pedestrian pathways and tree - lined avenues . melbourne ' s parks are often considered the best public parks in all of australia ' s major cities . there are also many parks in the surrounding suburbs of melbourne , such as in the municipalities of st ##on ##nington , bo ##ro ##onda ##ra and port phillip , south east of the central business district . the extensive area covered by urban melbourne is formally divided into hundreds of suburbs ( for addressing and postal purposes ) , and administered as local government areas 31 of which are located within the metropolitan area .
perceived promotion of crime [SEP] the story of the kelly gang , the world ' s first feature film , was shot in melbourne in 1906 . melbourne filmmakers continued to produce bush ##rang ##er films until they were banned by victorian politicians in 1912 for the perceived promotion of crime , thus contributing to the decline of one of the silent film era ' s most productive industries . a notable film shot and set in melbourne during australia ' s cinematic lu ##ll is on the beach ( 1959 ) . the 1970s saw the rise of the australian new wave and its oz ##pl ##oit ##ation offs ##hoot , ins ##ti ##gated by melbourne - based productions st ##or ##k and alvin purple . picnic at hanging rock and mad max , both shot in and around melbourne , achieved worldwide acclaim . 2004 saw the construction of melbourne ' s largest film and television studio complex , dock ##lands studios melbourne , which has hosted many domestic productions , as well as international features . melbourne is also home to the headquarters of village roads ##how pictures , australia ' s largest film production company . famous modern day actors from melbourne include cat ##e blanche ##tt , rachel griffiths , guy pearce , geoffrey rush and eric ban ##a .
sudden change in prices [SEP] at the start of john ' s reign there was a sudden change in prices , as bad harvest ##s and high demand for food resulted in much higher prices for grain and animals . this inflation ##ary pressure was to continue for the rest of the 13th century and had long - term economic consequences for england . the resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of def ##lation that resulted from john ' s military campaigns . it was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver , which was then re - mint ##ed into new coins ; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country , to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs . at those times when john was preparing for campaigns in normandy , for example , huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months , which un ##int ##ent ##ional ##ly resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by , commercial credit difficult to acquire and def ##lation ##ary pressure placed on the economy . the result was political unrest across the country . john attempted to address some of the problems with the english currency in 120 ##4 and 120 ##5 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage , improving its quality and consistency .
to counter a threat to gas ##con ##y from alfonso viii of castile [SEP] baron ##ial unrest in england prevented the departure of the planned 120 ##5 expedition , and only a smaller force under william long ##es ##pee deployed to po ##ito ##u . in 120 ##6 john departed for po ##ito ##u himself , but was forced to divert south to counter a threat to gas ##con ##y from alfonso viii of castile . after a successful campaign against alfonso , john headed north again , taking the city of anger ##s . philip moved south to meet john ; the year ' s campaigning ended in stale ##mate and a two - year truce was made between the two rulers .
to meet john [SEP] baron ##ial unrest in england prevented the departure of the planned 120 ##5 expedition , and only a smaller force under william long ##es ##pee deployed to po ##ito ##u . in 120 ##6 john departed for po ##ito ##u himself , but was forced to divert south to counter a threat to gas ##con ##y from alfonso viii of castile . after a successful campaign against alfonso , john headed north again , taking the city of anger ##s . philip moved south to meet john ; the year ' s campaigning ended in stale ##mate and a two - year truce was made between the two rulers .
potential of the royal legal process to raise fees [SEP] the administration of justice was of particular importance to john . several new processes had been introduced to english law under henry ii , including novel di ##sse ##isi ##n and mort d ' ancestor . these processes meant the royal courts had a more significant role in local law cases , which had previously been dealt with only by regional or local lords . john increased the professional ##ism of local sergeant ##s and bail ##iff ##s , and extended the system of coroner ##s first introduced by hubert walter in 119 ##4 , creating a new class of borough coroner ##s . john worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well , through judges he had appointed , by foster ##ing legal specialists and expertise , and by intervening in cases himself . john continued to try relatively minor cases , even during military crises . viewed positively , lewis warren considers that john discharged " his royal duty of providing justice . . . with a ze ##al and a tire ##lessness to which the english common law is greatly end ##eb ##ted " . seen more critically , john may have been motivated by the potential of the royal legal process to raise fees , rather than a desire to deliver simple justice ; john ' s legal system also only applied to free men , rather than to all of the population . nonetheless , these changes were popular with many free tenants , who acquired a more reliable legal system that could bypass the barons , against whom such cases were often brought . john ' s reforms were less popular with the barons themselves , especially as they remained subject to arbitrary and frequently vin ##dict ##ive royal justice .
southern flank weakening [SEP] john initially adopted a defensive posture similar to that of 119 ##9 : avoiding open battle and carefully defending his key castles . john ' s operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed , and philip began to make steady progress in the east . john became aware in july that arthur ' s forces were threatening his mother , eleanor , at mir ##eb ##eau castle . accompanied by william de roche ##s , his sen ##es ##chal in an ##jou , he swung his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her . his forces caught arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of mir ##eb ##eau . with his southern flank weakening , philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain john ' s army .
due to the risks of open battle [SEP] prince louis intended to land in the south of england in may 121 ##6 , and john assembled a naval force to intercept him . unfortunately for john , his fleet was dispersed by bad storms and louis landed unopposed in kent . john hesitated and decided not to attack louis immediately , either due to the risks of open battle or over concerns about the loyalty of his own men . louis and the rebel barons advanced west and john retreated , spending the summer re ##org ##ani ##sing his defences across the rest of the kingdom . john saw several of his military household desert to the rebels , including his half - brother , william long ##es ##pee . by the end of the summer the rebels had regained the south - east of england and parts of the north .
struggled [SEP] com ##pa ##q , who had previously held the third place spot among pc manufacturers during the 1980s and early - mid 1990s , initiated a successful price war in 1994 that vaulted them to the biggest by the year end , over ##taking a struggling ibm and re ##leg ##ating apple to third place . apple ' s market share further struggled due to the release of the windows 95 operating system , which unified microsoft ' s formerly separate ms - dos and windows products . windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of ibm pc compatible computers , and brought the capabilities of windows to par ##ity with the mac os gui .
for legal reasons [SEP] the macintosh project was begun in 1979 by je ##f ras ##kin , an apple employee who envisioned an easy - to - use , low - cost computer for the average consumer . he wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple , the mcintosh , but the spelling was changed to " macintosh " for legal reasons as the original was the same spelling as that used by mcintosh laboratory , inc . , the audio equipment manufacturer . steve jobs requested that mcintosh laboratory give apple a release for the name with its changed spelling so that apple could use it , but the request was denied , forcing apple to eventually buy the rights to use the name . ( a 1984 byte magazine article suggested apple changed the spelling only after " early users " miss ##pel ##led " mcintosh " . however , je ##f ras ##kin had adopted the macintosh spelling by 1981 , when the macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab . this explanation further clashes with the first explanation given above that the change was made for " legal reasons . " )
this was a time - consuming task [SEP] two days after " 1984 " aired , the macintosh went on sale , and came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface : mac ##write and mac ##pa ##int . it was first demonstrated by steve jobs in the first of his famous mac keynote speeches , and though the mac garnered an immediate , enthusiastic following , some labeled it a mere " toy . " because the operating system was designed largely around the gui , existing text - mode and command - driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code re ##written . this was a time - consuming task that many software developers chose not to undertake , and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system . in april 1984 , microsoft ' s multi ##pl ##an migrated over from ms - dos , with microsoft word following in january 1985 . in 1985 , lotus software introduced lotus jazz for the macintosh platform after the success of lotus 1 - 2 - 3 for the ibm pc , although it was largely a flop . apple introduced the macintosh office suite the same year with the " le ##mming ##s " ad . infamous for insulting its own potential customers , the ad was not successful .
too expensive [SEP] in 2000 , apple released the power mac g ##4 cube , their first desktop since the discontinued power macintosh g ##3 , to slot between the im ##ac g ##3 and the power mac g ##4 . even with its innovative design , it was initially priced us $ 200 higher than the com ##para ##bly - equipped and more - expand ##able base power mac g ##4 , while also not including a monitor , making it too expensive and resulting in slow sales . apple sold just 29 , 000 cube ##s in q ##4 of 2000 which was one third of expectations , compared to 308 , 000 mac ##s during that same quarter , and cube sales dropped to 12 , 000 units in q ##1 of 2001 . a price drop and hardware upgrades could not offset the earlier perception of the cube ' s reduced value compared to the im ##ac and power mac g ##4 lineup , and it was discontinued in july 2001 .
higher cost of the lcd technology [SEP] starting in 2002 , apple moved to eliminate cr ##t displays from its product line as part of aesthetic design and space - saving measures with the im ##ac g ##4 . however , the new im ##ac with its flexible lcd flat - panel monitor was considerably more expensive on its debut than the preceding im ##ac g ##3 , largely due to the higher cost of the lcd technology at the time . in order to keep the macintosh affordable for the education market and due to ob ##sol ##escence of the im ##ac g ##3 , apple created the em ##ac in april 2002 as the intended successor ; however the em ##ac ' s cr ##t made it relatively bulky and somewhat outdated , while its all - in - one construction meant it could not be expanded to meet consumer demand for larger monitors . the im ##ac g ##4 ' s relatively high prices were approaching that of laptop ##s which were portable and had higher resolution lcd screens . meanwhile , windows pc manufacturers could offer desktop configurations with lcd flat panel monitors at prices comparable to the em ##ac and at much lower cost than the im ##ac g ##4 . the flop of the power mac g ##4 cube , along with the more expensive im ##ac g ##4 and heavy em ##ac , meant that macintosh desktop sales never reached the market share attained by the previous im ##ac g ##3 . for the next half - decade while macintosh sales held steady , it would instead be the ipod portable music player and itunes music download service that would drive apple ' s sales growth .
over a personality conflict with jobs [SEP] burr ##el ' s innovative design , which combined the low production cost of an apple ii with the computing power of lisa ' s cpu , the motorola 68 ##k , received the attention of steve jobs , co - founder of apple . realizing that the macintosh was more market ##able than the lisa , he began to focus his attention on the project . ras ##kin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with jobs . team member andy her ##tz ##feld said that the final macintosh design is closer to jobs ' ideas than ras ##kin ' s . after hearing of the pioneering gui technology being developed at x ##ero ##x parc , jobs had negotiated a visit to see the x ##ero ##x alto computer and its small ##talk development tools in exchange for apple stock options . the lisa and macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at x ##ero ##x parc and were combined with the macintosh group ' s own ideas . jobs also commissioned industrial designer hart ##mut es ##sling ##er to work on the macintosh line , resulting in the " snow white " design language ; although it came too late for the earliest mac ##s , it was implemented in most other mid - to late - 1980s apple computers . however , jobs ' leadership at the macintosh project did not last ; after an internal power struggle with new ceo john sc ##ull ##ey , jobs resigned from apple in 1985 . he went on to found next , another computer company targeting the education market , and did not return until 1997 , when apple acquired next .
an internal power struggle [SEP] burr ##el ' s innovative design , which combined the low production cost of an apple ii with the computing power of lisa ' s cpu , the motorola 68 ##k , received the attention of steve jobs , co - founder of apple . realizing that the macintosh was more market ##able than the lisa , he began to focus his attention on the project . ras ##kin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with jobs . team member andy her ##tz ##feld said that the final macintosh design is closer to jobs ' ideas than ras ##kin ' s . after hearing of the pioneering gui technology being developed at x ##ero ##x parc , jobs had negotiated a visit to see the x ##ero ##x alto computer and its small ##talk development tools in exchange for apple stock options . the lisa and macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at x ##ero ##x parc and were combined with the macintosh group ' s own ideas . jobs also commissioned industrial designer hart ##mut es ##sling ##er to work on the macintosh line , resulting in the " snow white " design language ; although it came too late for the earliest mac ##s , it was implemented in most other mid - to late - 1980s apple computers . however , jobs ' leadership at the macintosh project did not last ; after an internal power struggle with new ceo john sc ##ull ##ey , jobs resigned from apple in 1985 . he went on to found next , another computer company targeting the education market , and did not return until 1997 , when apple acquired next .
both pilots died [SEP] on 30 september 1915 , troops of the serbian army observed three enemy aircraft approaching k ##rag ##uj ##eva ##c . soldiers shot at them with shotgun ##s and machine - guns but failed to prevent them from dropping 45 bombs over the city , hitting military installations , the railway station and many other , mostly civilian , targets in the city . during the bombing raid , private ra ##do ##je l ##ju ##tov ##ac fired his cannon at the enemy aircraft and successfully shot one down . it crashed in the city and both pilots died from their injuries . the cannon l ##ju ##tov ##ac used was not designed as an anti - aircraft gun , it was a slightly modified turkish cannon captured during the first balkan war in 1912 . this was the first occasion in military history that a military aircraft was shot down with ground - to - air fire .
for anti - aircraft fire [SEP] during the 1930s solid fuel rockets were under development in the soviet union and britain . in britain the interest was for anti - aircraft fire , it quickly became clear that guidance would be required for precision . however , rockets , or ' un ##rot ##ated projectile ##s ' as they were called could the used for anti - aircraft barrage ##s . a 2 - inch rocket using he or wire obstacle war ##heads was introduced first to deal with low - level or dive bombing attacks on smaller targets such as airfields . the 3 - inch was in development at the end of the inter - war period .
visit of the pope to valencia [SEP] in march 2012 , the newspaper el mundo published a story according to which f ##g ##v had instructed employees who were to testify at the crash commission investigation , providing a set of possible questions and guidelines to prepare the answers . in april 2013 , the television program sal ##va ##dos questioned the official version of the incident as there were indications that the valencia ##n government had tried to down ##play the accident , which coincided with the visit of the pope to valencia , or even to hide evidence , as the book of train breakdown ##s was never found . the day after the broadcast of this report , which received extensive media coverage , several voices called for the re ##open ##ing of the investigation . the investigation was effectively reopened and the accident is currently under re - examination .
plague [SEP] faced with this loss of business , valencia suffered a severe economic crisis . this manifested early in 151 ##9 – 152 ##3 when the art ##isan guild ##s known as the german ##ies revolt ##ed against the government of the habsburg king charles i in valencia , now part of the crown of aragon , with most of the fighting done in 152 ##1 . the revolt was an anti - monarch ##ist , anti - feudal auto ##no ##mist movement inspired by the italian republics , and a social revolt against the nobility who had fled the city before an epidemic of plague in 151 ##9 . it also bore a strong anti - islamic aspect , as rebels riot ##ed against aragon ' s population of mud ##ej ##ars and imposed forced conversions to christianity .
gulf of ton ##kin incident [SEP] the vietnam war is often regarded as a low point for the u . s . army due to the use of drafted personnel , the unpopular ##ity of the war with the american public , and frustrating restrictions placed on the military by american political leaders . while american forces had been stationed in the republic of vietnam since 1959 , in intelligence & advising / training roles , they did not deploy in large numbers until 1965 , after the gulf of ton ##kin incident . american forces effectively established and maintained control of the " traditional " battlefield , however they struggled to counter the guerrilla hit and run tactics of the communist viet cong and the north vietnamese army . on a tactical level , american soldiers ( and the u . s . military as a whole ) did not lose a sizable battle .
bismarck ' s demand for the return of alsace [SEP] when the war had begun , european public opinion heavily favored the germans ; many italians attempted to sign up as volunteers at the prussian embassy in florence and a prussian diplomat visited giuseppe ga ##ri ##baldi in cap ##rera . bismarck ' s demand for the return of alsace caused a dramatic shift in that sentiment in italy , which was best exemplified by the reaction of ga ##ri ##baldi soon after the revolution in paris , who told the mo ##vi ##mento of genoa on 7 september 1870 that " yesterday i said to you : war to the death to bonaparte . today i say to you : rescue the french republic by every means . " ga ##ri ##baldi went to france and assumed command of the army of the vo ##sg ##es , with which he operated around di ##jon till the end of the war .
time spent using the internet replaces time doing physical activities [SEP] although research has been inc ##on ##clusive , some findings have indicated that electronic communication negatively affects adolescents ' social development , replaces face - to - face communication , imp ##air ##s their social skills , and can sometimes lead to unsafe interaction with strangers . a 2015 review reported that “ adolescents lack awareness of strategies to cope with cyber ##bu ##lly ##ing , which has been consistently associated with an increased likelihood of depression . ” studies have shown differences in the ways the internet negatively impacts the adolescents ' social functioning . online social ##izing tends to make girls particularly vulnerable , while social ##izing in internet cafes seems only to affect boys academic achievement . however , other research suggests that internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for socially anxious teens , who find it easier to interact socially online . the more con ##clusive finding has been that internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents , as time spent using the internet replaces time doing physical activities . however , the internet can be significantly useful in educating teens because of the access they have to information on many various topics .
exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general [SEP] an adolescent ' s environment plays a huge role in their identity development . while most adolescent studies are conducted on white , middle class children , studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have , the more successfully they develop their identity . the forming of an adolescent ' s identity is a crucial time in their life . it has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century . accordingly , youth , a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood , has become a more prominent stage of the life course . this therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development . so many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment , to coping devices , to social media . all of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in . a child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general . an adolescent from an inner city or a crime - driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development . adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process , and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions . while children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development .
focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents [SEP] some researchers are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality ; they want to move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality . [ why ? ] college professor lucia o ' sullivan and her colleagues found that there weren ' t any significant gender differences in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7 - 12 reported . most teens said they had kissed their partners , held hands with them , thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship . this means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample . sexual events ( such as sexual touching , sexual intercourse ) were less common than romantic events ( holding hands ) and social events ( being with one ' s partner in a group setting ) . the researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences .
important food [SEP] the antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pe ##lt by seal ##ers from the united states and the united kingdom . the wed ##dell seal , a " true seal " , is named after sir james wed ##dell , commander of british sealing expeditions in the wed ##dell sea . antarctic k ##rill , which cong ##re ##gate in large schools , is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the southern ocean , and is an important food organism for whales , seals , leopard seals , fur seals , squid , ice ##fish , penguins , alba ##tro ##sse ##s and many other birds .
as a reward for their support during world war ii [SEP] in the 1950s , the ethiopian feudal administration under emperor hail ##e se ##lass ##ie sought to annex eritrea and italian somali ##land . he laid claim to both territories in a letter to franklin d . roosevelt at the paris peace conference and at the first session of the united nations . in the united nations , the debate over the fate of the former italian colonies continued . the british and americans preferred to ce ##de all of eritrea except the western province to the ethiopian ##s as a reward for their support during world war ii . the independence bloc of eritrea ##n parties consistently requested from the un general assembly that a referendum be held immediately to settle the eritrea ##n question of sovereignty .
their coastal location [SEP] a typical traditional eritrea ##n dish consists of in ##jer ##a accompanied by a spicy stew , which frequently includes beef , kid , lamb or fish . overall , eritrea ##n cuisine strongly resembles those of neighboring ethiopia , eritrea ##n cooking tend to feature more seafood than ethiopian cuisine on account of their coastal location . eritrea ##n dishes are also frequently " lighter " in texture than ethiopian meals . they likewise tend to employ less seasoned butter and spices and more tomatoes , as in the ts ##eb ##hi do ##rh ##o del ##ica ##cy .
phosphate fe ##rti ##lizer ##s [SEP] uranium ' s average concentration in the earth ' s crust is ( depending on the reference ) 2 to 4 parts per million , or about 40 times as abundant as silver . the earth ' s crust from the surface to 25 km ( 15 mi ) down is calculated to contain 101 ##7 kg ( 2 ##× ##10 ##17 lb ) of uranium while the oceans may contain 101 ##3 kg ( 2 ##× ##10 ##13 lb ) . the concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0 . 7 to 11 parts per million ( up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fe ##rti ##lizer ##s ) , and its concentration in sea water is 3 parts per billion .
ex ##cre ##ted [SEP] most ing ##ested uranium is ex ##cre ##ted during digest ##ion . only 0 . 5 % is absorbed when ins ##ol ##ub ##le forms of uranium , such as its oxide , are ing ##ested , whereas absorption of the more soluble ur ##any ##l ion can be up to 5 % . however , soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body , whereas ins ##ol ##ub ##le uranium compounds , especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs , pose a more serious exposure hazard . after entering the blood ##stream , the absorbed uranium tends to bio ##ac ##cum ##ulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium ' s affinity for phosphate ##s . uranium is not absorbed through the skin , and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin .
established their own orders [SEP] appointments to the order of the british empire were at first made on the nomination of the self - governing dominion ##s of the empire , the viceroy of india , and the colonial governors , as well as on nominations from within the united kingdom . as the empire evolved into the commonwealth , nominations continued to come from the commonwealth realms , in which the monarch remained head of state . these overseas nominations have been discontinued in realms that have established their own orders — such as the order of australia , the order of canada , and the new zealand order of merit — but members of the order are still appointed in the british overseas territories .
britain was at war [SEP] during the war , plans were drawn up to que ##ll welsh nationalism by af ##fi ##lia ##ting elizabeth more closely with wales . proposals , such as appointing her constable of ca ##ern ##ar ##fo ##n castle or a patron of ur ##dd go ##bai ##th cy ##m ##ru ( the welsh league of youth ) , were abandoned for various reasons , which included a fear of ass ##oc ##iating elizabeth with con ##sc ##ient ##ious object ##ors in the ur ##dd , at a time when britain was at war . welsh politicians suggested that she be made princess of wales on her 18th birthday . home secretary , herbert morrison supported the idea , but the king rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a prince of wales and the prince of wales had always been the heir apparent . in 1946 , she was inducted into the welsh go ##rse ##dd of bard ##s at the national e ##iste ##dd ##fo ##d of wales .
they act as trade ##offs such , whereby to be more feminine one had to be less masculine and vice versa [SEP] a third concern with the kin ##sey scale is that it inappropriate ##ly measures heterosexual ##ity and homosexuality on the same scale , making one a trade ##off of the other . research in the 1970s on mas ##cu ##lini ##ty and fe ##mini ##nity found that concepts of mas ##cu ##lini ##ty and fe ##mini ##nity are more appropriately measured as independent concepts on a separate scale rather than as a single continuum , with each end representing opposite extremes . when compared on the same scale , they act as trade ##offs such , whereby to be more feminine one had to be less masculine and vice versa . however , if they are considered as separate dimensions one can be simultaneously very masculine and very feminine . similarly , considering heterosexual ##ity and homosexuality on separate scales would allow one to be both very heterosexual and very homosexual or not very much of either . when they are measured independently , the degree of heterosexual and homosexual can be independently determined , rather than the balance between heterosexual and homosexual as determined using the kin ##sey scale .
ambiguity regarding the definition of sexual orientation [SEP] research focusing on sexual orientation uses scales of assessment to identify who belongs in which sexual population group . it is assumed that these scales will be able to re ##lia ##bly identify and cat ##ego ##rize people by their sexual orientation . however , it is difficult to determine an individual ' s sexual orientation through scales of assessment , due to ambiguity regarding the definition of sexual orientation . generally , there are three components of sexual orientation used in assessment . their definitions and examples of how they may be assessed are as follows :
english terms lack equivalent ##s in other languages , while concepts and words from other languages fail to be reflected in the english language . [SEP] translation is a major obstacle when comparing different cultures . many english terms lack equivalent ##s in other languages , while concepts and words from other languages fail to be reflected in the english language . translation and vocabulary obstacles are not limited to the english language . language can force individuals to identify with a label that may or may not accurately reflect their true sexual orientation . language can also be used to signal sexual orientation to others . the meaning of words referencing categories of sexual orientation are negotiated in the mass media in relation to social organization . new words may be brought into use to describe new terms or better describe complex interpretations of sexual orientation . other words may pick up new layers or meaning . for example , the heterosexual spanish terms mari ##do and mu ##jer for " husband " and " wife " , respectively , have recently been replaced in spain by the gender - neutral terms con ##yu ##ges or consort ##es meaning " spouse ##s " .
racial stereotypes merge with gender stereotypes [SEP] in the united states , non - caucasian lgbt individuals may find themselves in a double minority , where they are neither fully accepted or understood by mainly caucasian lgbt communities , nor are they accepted by their own ethnic group . many people experience racism in the dominant lgbt community where racial stereotypes merge with gender stereotypes , such that asian - american lgbt ##s are viewed as more passive and feminine , while african - american lgbt ##s are viewed as more masculine and aggressive . there are a number of culturally specific support networks for lgbt individuals active in the united states . for example , " o - moi " for vietnamese american queer females .
they lack medical justification and represent a serious threat to the health and well - being of affected people , [SEP] in 2012 , the pan american health organization ( the north and south american branch of the world health organization ) released a statement caution ##ing against services that pu ##rp ##ort to " cure " people with non - heterosexual sexual orientation ##s as they lack medical justification and represent a serious threat to the health and well - being of affected people , and noted that the global scientific and professional consensus is that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality and cannot be regarded as a path ##ological condition . the pan american health organization further called on governments , academic institutions , professional associations and the media to expose these practices and to promote respect for diversity . the world health organization affiliate further noted that gay minors have sometimes been forced to attend these " the ##ra ##pies " in ##vo ##lun ##tar ##ily , being deprived of their liberty and sometimes kept in isolation for several months , and that these findings were reported by several united nations bodies . additionally , the pan american health organization recommended that such mal ##pr ##actic ##es be denounced and subject to sanctions and penalties under national legislation , as they constitute a violation of the ethical principles of health care and violate human rights that are protected by international and regional agreements .
to address the major concerns with the kin ##sey scale and klein sexual orientation grid [SEP] the sell assessment of sexual orientation ( sas ##o ) was developed to address the major concerns with the kin ##sey scale and klein sexual orientation grid and as such , measures sexual orientation on a continuum , considers various dimensions of sexual orientation , and considers homosexuality and heterosexual ##ity separately . rather than providing a final solution to the question of how to best measure sexual orientation , the sas ##o is meant to provoke discussion and debate about measurements of sexual orientation .
because of the limited populations that each component captures [SEP] as there is no research indicating which of the three components is essential in defining sexual orientation , all three are used independently and provide different conclusions regarding sexual orientation . sa ##vin williams ( 2006 ) discusses this issue and notes that by basin ##g findings regarding sexual orientation on a single component , researchers may not actually capture the intended population . for example , if homosexual is defined by same sex behavior , gay virgin ##s are omitted , heterosexual ##s engaging in same sex behavior for other reasons than preferred sexual arousal are mis ##co ##unt ##ed , and those with same sex attraction who only have opposite - sex relations are excluded . because of the limited populations that each component captures , consumers of research should be cautious in general ##izing these findings .
the random ##ness of his sample population , [SEP] in the of ##t - cited and of ##t - criticized sexual behavior in the human male ( 1948 ) and sexual behavior in the human female ( 1953 ) , by alfred c . kin ##sey et al . , people were asked to rate themselves on a scale from completely heterosexual to completely homosexual . kin ##sey reported that when the individuals ' behavior as well as their identity are analyzed , most people appeared to be at least somewhat bisexual — i . e . , most people have some attraction to either sex , although usually one sex is preferred . according to kin ##sey , only a minority ( 5 – 10 % ) can be considered fully heterosexual or homosexual . [ citation needed ] conversely , only an even smaller minority can be considered fully bisexual ( with an equal attraction to both sexes ) . kin ##sey ' s methods have been criticized as flawed , particularly with regard to the random ##ness of his sample population , which included prison inmates , male prostitutes and those who willingly participated in discussion of previously taboo sexual topics . nevertheless , paul ge ##bha ##rd , subsequent director of the kin ##sey institute for sex research , re ##ex ##amine ##d the data in the kin ##sey reports and concluded that removing the prison inmates and prostitutes barely affected the results .
this was true anatomical ##ly and therefore also psychological ##ly , with sexual attraction to both sexes being one part of this psychological bisexual ##ity [SEP] innate bisexual ##ity is an idea introduced by si ##gm ##und freud . according to this theory , all humans are born bisexual in a very broad sense of the term , that of incorporating general aspects of both sexes . in freud ' s view , this was true anatomical ##ly and therefore also psychological ##ly , with sexual attraction to both sexes being one part of this psychological bisexual ##ity . freud believed that in the course of sexual development the masculine side would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women , but that as adults everyone still has desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their nature ##s . freud did not claim that everyone is bisexual in the sense of feeling the same level of sexual attraction to both gender ##s .
the affected s [SEP] using and ##rop ##hil ##ia and g ##yne ##phi ##lia can avoid confusion and offense when describing people in non - western cultures , as well as when describing inter ##se ##x and transgender people . psychiatrist an ##il ag ##gra ##wal explains that and ##rop ##hil ##ia , along with g ##yne ##phi ##lia , " is needed to overcome immense difficulties in character ##izing the sexual orientation of trans men and trans women . for instance , it is difficult to decide whether a trans man erotic ##ally attracted to males is a heterosexual female or a homosexual male ; or a trans woman erotic ##ally attracted to females is a heterosexual male or a lesbian female . any attempt to classify them may not only cause confusion but ar ##ouse offense among the affected subjects . in such cases , while defining sexual attraction , it is best to focus on the object of their attraction rather than on the sex or gender of the subject . " sex ##ologist milton diamond writes , " the terms heterosexual , homosexual , and bisexual are better used as adjective ##s , not nouns , and are better applied to behaviors , not people . this usage is particularly advantage ##ous when discussing the partners of trans ##se ##x ##ual or inter ##se ##xed individuals . these newer terms also do not carry the social weight of the former ones . "
collapsing the two values into one final score [SEP] wei ##nr ##ich et al . ( 1993 ) and wei ##nberg et al . ( 1994 ) criticized the scale for lump ##ing individuals who are different based on different dimensions of sexuality into the same categories . when applying the scale , kin ##sey considered two dimensions of sexual orientation : over ##t sexual experience and psycho ##se ##x ##ual reactions . valuable information was lost by collapsing the two values into one final score . a person who has only predominantly same sex reactions is different from someone with relatively little reaction but lots of same sex experience . it would have been quite simple for kin ##sey to have measured the two dimensions separately and report scores independently to avoid loss of information . furthermore , there are more than two dimensions of sexuality to be considered . beyond behavior and reactions , one could also assess attraction , identification , lifestyle etc . this is addressed by the klein sexual orientation grid .
a person who has only predominantly same sex reactions is different from someone with relatively little reaction but lots of same sex experience [SEP] wei ##nr ##ich et al . ( 1993 ) and wei ##nberg et al . ( 1994 ) criticized the scale for lump ##ing individuals who are different based on different dimensions of sexuality into the same categories . when applying the scale , kin ##sey considered two dimensions of sexual orientation : over ##t sexual experience and psycho ##se ##x ##ual reactions . valuable information was lost by collapsing the two values into one final score . a person who has only predominantly same sex reactions is different from someone with relatively little reaction but lots of same sex experience . it would have been quite simple for kin ##sey to have measured the two dimensions separately and report scores independently to avoid loss of information . furthermore , there are more than two dimensions of sexuality to be considered . beyond behavior and reactions , one could also assess attraction , identification , lifestyle etc . this is addressed by the klein sexual orientation grid .
sexual attraction is a better reflection of the concept of sexual orientation [SEP] of all the questions on the scale , sell considered those assessing sexual attraction to be the most important as sexual attraction is a better reflection of the concept of sexual orientation which he defined as " extent of sexual attractions toward members of the other , same , both sexes or neither " than either sexual identity or sexual behavior . identity and behavior are measured as supplemental information because they are both closely tied to sexual attraction and sexual orientation . major criticisms of the sas ##o have not been established , but a concern is that the reliability and validity remains largely une ##xa ##mined .
because sexual orientation is complex and multi - dimensional [SEP] because sexual orientation is complex and multi - dimensional , some academics and researchers , especially in queer studies , have argued that it is a historical and social construction . in 1976 , philosopher and historian michel f ##ou ##ca ##ult argued in the history of sexuality that homosexuality as an identity did not exist in the eighteenth century ; that people instead spoke of " so ##dom ##y , " which referred to sexual acts . so ##dom ##y was a crime that was often ignored , but sometimes punished severely ( see so ##dom ##y law ) . he wrote , " ' sexuality ' is an invention of the modern state , the industrial revolution , and capitalism . "
to combat the assumption at the time that people are either heterosexual or homosexual [SEP] the kin ##sey scale , also called the heterosexual - homosexual rating scale , was first published in sexual behavior in the human male ( 1948 ) by alfred kin ##sey , ward ##ell po ##mer ##oy , and clyde martin and also featured in sexual behavior in the human female ( 1953 ) . the scale was developed to combat the assumption at the time that people are either heterosexual or homosexual and that these two types represent anti ##thes ##es in the sexual world . recognizing that a large portion of population is not completely heterosexual or homosexual and people can experience both heterosexual and homosexual behavior and psychic responses , kin ##sey et al . , stated :
response to the criticism of the kin ##sey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation [SEP] in response to the criticism of the kin ##sey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation , fritz klein developed the klein sexual orientation grid ( ks ##og ) , a multi ##dim ##ens ##ional scale for describing sexual orientation . introduced in klein ' s book the bisexual option , the ks ##og uses a 7 - point scale to assess seven different dimensions of sexuality at three different points in an individual ' s life : past ( from early adolescence up to one year ago ) , present ( within the last 12 months ) , and ideal ( what would you choose if it were completely your choice ) .
declines [SEP] dell has been attempting to offset its declining pc business , which still accounted for half of its revenue and generates steady cash flow , by expanding into the enterprise market with servers , networking , software , and services . it avoided many of the acquisition write ##down ##s and management turnover that plagued its chief rival he ##wl ##ett packard . dell also managed some success in taking advantage of its high - touch direct sales heritage to establish close relationships and design solutions for clients . despite spending $ 13 billion on acquisitions to divers ##ify its portfolio beyond hardware , the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive or made the transformation in the post - pc world , as it suffered continued declines in revenue and share price . dell ' s market share in the corporate segment was previously a " moat " against rivals but this has no longer been the case as sales and profits have fallen pre ##ci ##pit ##ously .
to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights [SEP] under the anti ##ter ##ror ##ism and effective death penalty act of 1996 , a state prisoner is or ##dina ##rily only allowed one suit for ha ##be ##as corpus in federal court . if the federal courts refuse to issue a writ of ha ##be ##as corpus , an execution date may be set . in recent times , however , prisoners have postponed execution through a final round of federal litigation using the civil rights act of 1871 — cod ##ified at 42 u . s . c . § 1983 — which allows people to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights .
because it is morally rep ##re ##hen ##sible [SEP] both rousseau and locke ' s social contract theories rest on the pre ##su ##pp ##osition of natural rights , which are not a result of law or custom , but are things that all men have in pre - political societies , and are therefore universal and ina ##lie ##nable . the most famous natural right formulation comes from john locke in his second treatise , when he introduces the state of nature . for locke the law of nature is grounded on mutual security , or the idea that one cannot in ##fr ##inge on another ' s natural rights , as every man is equal and has the same ina ##lie ##nable rights . these natural rights include perfect equality and freedom , and the right to preserve life and property . locke also argued against slavery on the basis that en ##sl ##avi ##ng yourself goes against the law of nature ; you cannot surrender your own rights , your freedom is absolute and no one can take it from you . additionally , locke argues that one person cannot en ##sl ##ave another because it is morally rep ##re ##hen ##sible , although he introduces a cave ##at by saying that en ##sl ##ave ##ment of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one ' s natural rights .
the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multi ##ply [SEP] along with secular matters , readers also favoured an alphabet ##ical ordering scheme over cum ##bers ##ome works arranged along thematic lines . the historian charles por ##set , commenting on alphabet ##ization , has said that " as the zero degree of taxonomy , alphabet ##ical order author ##izes all reading strategies ; in this respect it could be considered an emblem of the enlightenment . " for por ##set , the avoidance of thematic and hierarchical systems thus allows free interpretation of the works and becomes an example of e ##gal ##itarian ##ism . encyclopedia ##s and di ##ction ##aries also became more popular during the age of reason as the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multi ##ply . in the later half of the 18th century , the number of di ##ction ##aries and encyclopedia ##s published by decade increased from 63 between 1760 and 1769 to approximately 148 in the decade proceeding the french revolution ( 1780 – 1789 ) . along with growth in numbers , di ##ction ##aries and encyclopedia ##s also grew in length , often having multiple print runs that sometimes included in supplemented editions .
a high rise in the availability of food [SEP] one of the most important developments that the enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popular ##ization . an increasingly liter ##ate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning . the new liter ##ate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food . this enabled many people to rise out of poverty , and instead of paying more for food , they had money for education . popular ##ization was generally part of an over ##ar ##ching enlightenment ideal that endeavour ##ed " to make information available to the greatest number of people . " as public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century , public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies . more formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text . sir isaac newton ' s celebrated phil ##oso ##phi ##ae natural ##is pri ##nc ##ip ##ia math ##ema ##tica was published in latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular .
cost reasons [SEP] the game pad controllers were more - or - less copied directly from the game & watch machines , although the fa ##mic ##om design team originally wanted to use arcade - style joy ##stick ##s , even taking apart ones from american game consoles to see how they worked . however , it was eventually decided that children might step on joy ##stick ##s left on the floor and their du ##ra ##bility was also questioned . kat ##su ##yah nak ##awa ##ka attached a game & watch d - pad to the fa ##mic ##om prototype and found that it was easy to use and had no discomfort . ultimately though , they did install a 15 - pin expansion port on the front of the console so that an arcade - style joy ##stick could be used optional ##ly . the controllers were hard - wired to the console with no connector ##s for cost reasons .
refusing to pay the licensing fee or having been rejected by nintendo [SEP] several companies , refusing to pay the licensing fee or having been rejected by nintendo , found ways to ci ##rc ##um ##vent the console ' s authentication system . most of these companies created circuits that used a voltage spike to temporarily di ##sable the 10 ##nes chip in the nes . a few un ##lice ##nsed games released in europe and australia came in the form of a dong ##le that would be connected to a licensed game , in order to use the licensed game ' s 10 ##nes chip for authentication . in order to combat un ##lice ##nsed games , nintendo of america threatened retailers who sold them with losing their supply of licensed titles . in addition , multiple revisions were made to the nes pc ##bs to prevent these games from working .
strict licensing requirements [SEP] nintendo was accused of anti ##trust behavior because of the strict licensing requirements . the united states department of justice and several states began probing nintendo ' s business practices , leading to the involvement of congress and the federal trade commission ( ft ##c ) . the ft ##c conducted an extensive investigation which included interviewing hundreds of retailers . during the ft ##c probe , nintendo changed the terms of its publisher licensing agreements to eliminate the two - year rule and other restrictive terms . nintendo and the ft ##c settled the case in april 1991 , with nintendo required to send vo ##ucher ##s giving a $ 5 discount off to a new game , to every person that had purchased a nes title between june 1988 and december 1990 . games ##py remarked that nintendo ' s punishment was particularly weak giving the case ' s findings , although it has been speculated that the ft ##c did not want to damage the video game industry in the united states .
flung into prison and murdered [SEP] the aria ##ns no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents . the emperor constant ##ius , who had been the cause of so much trouble , died 4 november , 36 ##1 and was succeeded by julian . the proclamation of the new prince ' s accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant aria ##n faction in alexandria . george , the us ##ur ##ping bishop , was flung into prison and murdered . an obscure pre ##sby ##ter of the name of pi ##st ##us was immediately chosen by the aria ##ns to succeed him , when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope . an edict had been put forth by julian permitting the exiled bishops of the " gal ##ile ##ans " to return to their " towns and provinces " . at ##hana ##sius received a summons from his own flock , and he accordingly re - entered his episcopal capitol on 22 february , 36 ##2 .
spreading of the as ##ce ##tic ideal in eastern and western christianity [SEP] his biography of anthony the great entitled life of antony ( β ##ι ##ος κ ##α ##ι π ##ο ##λ ##ι ##τ ##ε ##ια π ##α ##τ ##ρ ##ος α ##ν ##τ ##ω ##ν ##ι ##ου , vita anton ##ii ) became his most widely - read work . translated into several languages , it played an important role in the spreading of the as ##ce ##tic ideal in eastern and western christianity . depicting anthony as an ill ##iter ##ate and holy man who through his existence in a pri ##mo ##rdial landscape has an absolute connection to the divine truth , the biography also resembles the life of his biographer at ##hana ##sius . it later served as an inspiration to christian monastic ##s in both the east and the west . the so - called at ##hana ##sian creed dates from well after at ##hana ##sius ' s death and draws upon the phrase ##ology of augustine ' s de tri ##ni ##tate .
jesus of nazareth , is of a distinct substance from the father [SEP] conflict with ari ##us and aria ##nism as well as successive roman emperors shaped at ##hana ##sius ' s career . in 325 , at the age of 27 , at ##hana ##sius began his leading role against the aria ##ns as his bishop ' s assistant during the first council of nic ##aea . roman emperor constantine the great had convened the council in may – august 325 to address the aria ##n position that the son of god , jesus of nazareth , is of a distinct substance from the father . three years after that council , at ##hana ##sius succeeded his mentor as archbishop of alexandria . in addition to the conflict with the aria ##ns ( including powerful and influential aria ##n church ##men led by eu ##se ##bius of nico ##media ) , he struggled against the emperors constantine , constant ##ius ii , julian the ap ##osta ##te and vale ##ns . he was known as " at ##hana ##sius contra mu ##nd ##um " ( latin for at ##hana ##sius against the world ) .
not been properly cat ##ech ##ized [SEP] ru ##fin ##us relates a story that as bishop alexander stood by a window , he watched boys playing on the seas ##hore below , im ##itating the ritual of christian baptism . he sent for the children and discovered that one of the boys ( at ##hana ##sius ) had acted as bishop . after questioning at ##hana ##sius , bishop alexander informed him that the baptism ##s were genuine , as both the form and matter of the sacrament had been performed through the rec ##itation of the correct words and the administration of water , and that he must not continue to do this as those baptized had not been properly cat ##ech ##ized . he invited at ##hana ##sius and his play ##fell ##ows to prepare for clerical careers .
civil war [SEP] after the death of the replacement bishop gregory in 345 , con ##stan ##s used his influence to allow at ##hana ##sius to return to alexandria in october 345 , amidst the enthusiastic demonstrations of the populace . this began a " golden decade " of peace and prosperity , during which time at ##hana ##sius assembled several documents relating to his exiles and returns from exile in the apology against the aria ##ns . however , upon con ##stan ##s ' s death in 350 , another civil war broke out , which left pro - aria ##n constant ##ius as sole emperor . an alexandria local council in 350 replaced ( or re ##af ##firmed ) at ##hana ##sius in his see .
threats of the emperor [SEP] t . gil ##mart ##in , ( professor of history , may ##no ##oth , 1890 ) , writes in church history , vol . 1 , ch xvi ##i : by constant ##ius ' s order , the sole ruler of the roman empire at the death of his brother con ##stan ##s , the council of ar ##les in 35 ##3 , was held , which was presided over by vincent , bishop of cap ##ua , in the name of pope li ##ber ##ius . the fathers terrified of the threats of the emperor , an av ##owed aria ##n , they consent ##ed to the condemnation of at ##hana ##sius . the pope refused to accept their decision , and requested the emperor to hold another council , in which the charges against at ##hana ##sius could be freely investigated . to this constant ##ius consent ##ed , for he felt able to control it , at milan . milan was named as the place , here three hundred bishops assembled , most from the west , only a few from the east , in 355 . they met in the church of milan . shortly , the emperor ordered them to a hall in the imperial palace , thus ending any free debate . he presented an aria ##n formula of faith for their acceptance . he threatened any who refused with exile and death . all , with the exception of dion ##ys ##ius ( bishop of milan ) , and the two papal leg ##ates , viz . , eu ##se ##bius of ve ##rce ##lli and lucifer of ca ##glia ##ri , consent ##ed to the aria ##n creed and the condemnation of at ##hana ##sius . those who refused were sent into exile . the decrees were forward ##ed to the pope for approval , but were rejected , because of the violence to which the bishops were subjected .

murder [SEP] in 36 ##1 , after the death of emperor constant ##ius , shortly followed by the murder of the very unpopular bishop george , at ##hana ##sius returned to his patriarch ##ate . the following year he convened a council at alexandria , and presided over it with eu ##se ##bius of ve ##rce ##lli . at ##hana ##sius appealed for unity among all those who had faith in christianity , even if they differed on matters of terminology . this prepared the ground ##work for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the trinity . however , the council also was directed against those who denied the divinity of the holy spirit , the human soul of christ , and christ ' s divinity . mild measures were agreed on for those here ##tic bishops who rep ##ented , but severe pena ##nce was decreed for the chief leaders of the major here ##sies .
severe pena ##nce [SEP] in 36 ##1 , after the death of emperor constant ##ius , shortly followed by the murder of the very unpopular bishop george , at ##hana ##sius returned to his patriarch ##ate . the following year he convened a council at alexandria , and presided over it with eu ##se ##bius of ve ##rce ##lli . at ##hana ##sius appealed for unity among all those who had faith in christianity , even if they differed on matters of terminology . this prepared the ground ##work for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the trinity . however , the council also was directed against those who denied the divinity of the holy spirit , the human soul of christ , and christ ' s divinity . mild measures were agreed on for those here ##tic bishops who rep ##ented , but severe pena ##nce was decreed for the chief leaders of the major here ##sies .
a result of at ##hana ##sius [SEP] the gospel of john and particularly the first chapter demonstrates the divinity of jesus . this gospel in itself is the greatest support of at ##hana ##sius ' s stand . the gospel of john ' s first chapter began to be said at the end of mass , we believe as a result of at ##hana ##sius , and his life ' s stand , but quietly . the last gospel of the mass , the eu ##cha ##rist , st john [ 1 : 1 – 14 ] , together with the prayer ; " place ##at ti ##bi " , the blessing , are all private devotion ##s that have been gradually absorbed by the liturgical service . the beginning of john ' s gospel was much used as an object of special devotion throughout the middle ages . nevertheless , the practice of saying it at the altar grew ; eventually pius v made this practice universal for the roman rite in his edition of the miss ##al ( 1570 ) . it became a firm custom with exceptions in using an other gospel in use from 1920 . so the miss ##als showed different last gospel for certain feast days . a prayer card for the st john ' s gospel . also :
police reactions [SEP] seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies , but also by hosting the 1990 goodwill games and the ape ##c leaders conference in 1993 , as well as through the worldwide popularity of gr ##ung ##e , a sound that had developed in seattle ' s independent music scene . another bid for worldwide attention — hosting the world trade organization ministerial conference of 1999 — garnered visibility , but not in the way its sponsors desired , as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself . the city was further shaken by the mar ##di gr ##as riots in 2001 , and then literally shaken the following day by the ni ##s ##qual ##ly earthquake .
g allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli . [SEP] in psychology , memory is the process in which information is encoded , stored , and retrieved . encoding allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli . in the first stage the information must be changed so that it may be put into the encoding process . storage is the second memory stage or process . this en ##tails that information is maintained over short periods of time . finally the third process is the retrieval of information that has been stored . such information must be located and returned to the consciousness . some retrieval attempts may be effort ##less due to the type of information , and other attempts to remember stored information may be more demanding for various reasons .
because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers [SEP] short - term memory is also known as working memory . short - term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal . its capacity is also very limited : george a . miller ( 1956 ) , when working at bell laboratories , conducted experiments showing that the store of short - term memory was 7 ##± ##2 items ( the title of his famous paper , " the magical number 7 ##± ##2 " ) . modern estimates of the capacity of short - term memory are lower , typically of the order of 4 – 5 items ; however , memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunk ##ing . for example , in recalling a ten - digit telephone number , a person could chunk the digits into three groups : first , the area code ( such as 123 ) , then a three - digit chunk ( 45 ##6 ) and lastly a four - digit chunk ( 78 ##90 ) . this method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits ; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers . this may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers .
do not have the language ability to report on their memories [SEP] infants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young children ’ s memory . throughout the years , however , researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants ’ recognition memory and their recall memory . habit ##uation and opera ##nt conditioning techniques have been used to assess infants ’ recognition memory and the def ##erre ##d and eli ##cite ##d imitation techniques have been used to assess infants ’ recall memory .
stress [SEP] stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning . in response to stress ##ful situations , the brain releases hormones and ne ##uro ##tra ##ns ##mit ##ters ( ex . g ##lu ##co ##cor ##tic ##oids and cat ##ech ##ola ##mine ##s ) which affect memory encoding processes in the hip ##po ##camp ##us . behaviour ##al research on animals shows that chronic stress produces ad ##ren ##al hormones which impact the hip ##po ##camp ##al structure in the brains of rats . an experimental study by german cognitive psychologists l . sc ##hwa ##be and o . wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans . in this study , 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group . those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water ( the rep ##utable sec ##pt or ‘ socially evaluated cold press ##or test ’ ) for up to three minutes , while being monitored and video ##ta ##ped . both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memo ##rize . twenty - four hours later , both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember ( free recall ) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words ( recognition performance ) . the results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group , who recalled 30 % fewer words than the control group . the researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distract ##s people by divert ##ing their attention during the memory encoding process .
that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored [SEP] much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders , particularly amnesia . loss of memory is known as amnesia . amnesia can result from extensive damage to : ( a ) the regions of the medial temporal lobe , such as the hip ##po ##camp ##us , dent ##ate g ##yr ##us , sub ##ic ##ulum , amy ##g ##dal ##a , the para ##hip ##po ##camp ##al , en ##tor ##hin ##al , and per ##ir ##hin ##al co ##rti ##ces or the ( b ) mid ##line die ##nce ##pha ##lic region , specifically the do ##rso ##media ##l nucleus of the tha ##lam ##us and the ma ##mm ##illa ##ry bodies of the h ##yp ##oth ##ala ##mus . there are many sorts of amnesia , and by studying their different forms , it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub - systems of the brain ' s memory systems , and thus h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ize their function in the normally working brain . other neurological disorders such as alzheimer ' s disease and parkinson ' s disease can also affect memory and cognition . hyper ##thy ##mes ##ia , or hyper ##thy ##mes ##ic syndrome , is a disorder that affects an individual ' s autobiographical memory , essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored . ko ##rsa ##koff ' s syndrome , also known as ko ##rsa ##koff ' s psycho ##sis , am ##nes ##ic - con ##fa ##bula ##tory syndrome , is an organic brain disease that adverse ##ly affects memory by widespread loss or shrink ##age of neurons within the pre ##front ##al cortex .
repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced [SEP] interesting ##ly , research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories . for instance , go ##ff and roe ##di ##ger ( 1998 ) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act ( e . g . , break a tooth ##pic ##k ) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing . findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment . similarly , garry and her colleagues ( 1996 ) asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children ( e . g . , broke a window with their hand ) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events . the researchers found that one - fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children . that is , when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events .
due to changing historical forces and new immigration laws in the 1960s [SEP] by 1990 , the census bureau included more than a dozen ethnic / racial categories on the census , reflecting not only changing social ideas about ethnicity , but the wide variety of immigrants who had come to reside in the united states due to changing historical forces and new immigration laws in the 1960s . with a changing society , more citizens have begun to press for acknowledging multi ##rac ##ial ancestry . the census bureau changed its data collection by allowing people to self - identify as more than one ethnicity . some ethnic groups are concerned about the potential political and economic effects , as federal assistance to historically under ##ser ##ved groups has depended on census data . according to the census bureau , as of 2002 , over 75 % of all african americans had multi ##rac ##ial an ##ces ##tries .
slavery became a racial caste [SEP] americans with sub - saharan african ancestry for historical reasons : slavery , part ##us se ##qui ##tur vent ##rem , one - eighth law , the one - drop rule of 20th - century legislation , have frequently been classified as black ( historically ) or african american , even if they have significant european american or native american ancestry . as slavery became a racial caste , those who were enslaved and others of any african ancestry were classified by what is termed " h ##yp ##odes ##cent " according to the lower status ethnic group . many of majority european ancestry and appearance " married white " and ass ##imi ##lated into white society for its social and economic advantages , such as generations of families identified as mel ##ung ##eon ##s , now generally classified as white but demonstrated genetically to be of european and sub - saharan african ancestry .
more people are openly forming inter ##rac ##ial unions [SEP] after a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former confederacy following the reconstruction era , and ban ##s on inter ##rac ##ial marriage in various parts of the country , more people are openly forming inter ##rac ##ial unions . in addition , social conditions have changed and many multi ##rac ##ial people do not believe it is socially advantage ##ous to try to " pass " as white . diverse immigration has brought more mixed - race people into the united states , such as the large population of hispanic ##s identifying as me ##sti ##zos . since the 1980s , the united states has had a growing multi ##rac ##ial identity movement ( cf . loving day ) . because more americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins , the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one et ##hn ##o - racial identity and thereby identify as multi ##rac ##ial . in 2008 barack obama was elected as the first multi ##rac ##ial president of the united states ; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as african american .

white men from taking slave women as con ##cu ##bine ##s and having multi ##rac ##ial children with them [SEP] anti - mis ##ce ##gen ##ation laws were passed in most states during the 18th , 19th and early 20th centuries , but this did not prevent white slave ##holders , their sons , or other powerful white men from taking slave women as con ##cu ##bine ##s and having multi ##rac ##ial children with them . in california and the western us , there were greater numbers of latino and asian residents . these were prohibited from official relationships with whites . white legislators passed laws prohibiting marriage between european and asian americans until the 1950s .
revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves [SEP] after the american revolutionary war , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the north and the south as slaves were freed . most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like new york , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . the last slaves in new york were not freed until 1827 . in connection with the second great awakening , quaker and methodist preacher ##s in the south urged slave ##holders to free their slaves . revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the south .

in their attempt to ensure white supremacy decades after emancipation [SEP] in their attempt to ensure white supremacy decades after emancipation , in the early 20th century , most southern states created laws based on the one - drop rule , defining as black , persons with any known african ancestry . this was a strict ##er interpretation than what had prevailed in the 19th century ; it ignored the many mixed families in the state and went against commonly accepted social rules of judging a person by appearance and association . some courts called it " the trace ##able amount rule . " anthropologist ##s called it an example of a h ##yp ##odes ##cent rule , meaning that racial ##ly mixed persons were assigned the status of the socially subordinate group .
prior to the mid - 20th century , many people hid their multi ##rac ##ial heritage because of racial discrimination against minorities [SEP] multi ##rac ##ial americans are americans who have mixed ancestry of " two or more races " . the term may also include americans of mixed - race ancestry who self - identify with just one group culturally and socially ( cf . the one - drop rule ) . in the 2010 us census , approximately 9 million individuals , or 2 . 9 % of the population , self - identified as multi ##rac ##ial . there is evidence that an accounting by genetic ancestry would produce a higher number , but people live according to social and cultural identities , not dna . historical reasons , including slavery creating a racial caste and the european - american suppression of native americans , often led people to identify or be classified by only one ethnicity , generally that of the culture in which they were raised . prior to the mid - 20th century , many people hid their multi ##rac ##ial heritage because of racial discrimination against minorities . while many americans may be biological ##ly multi ##rac ##ial , they often do not know it or do not identify so culturally , any more than they maintain all the differing traditions of a variety of national an ##ces ##tries .
for their education [SEP] some europeans living among indigenous americans were called " white indians " . they " lived in native communities for years , learned native languages fluent ##ly , attended native councils , and often fought alongside their native companions . " more numerous and typical were traders and trap ##pers , who married indigenous american women from tribes on the frontier and had families with them . some traders , who kept bases in the cities , had what ware called " country wives " among indigenous americans , with legal european - american wives and children at home in the city . not all abandoned their " natural " mixed - race children . some arranged for sons to be sent to european - american schools for their education .
to restore white supremacy [SEP] racial discrimination continued to be enacted in new laws in the 20th century , for instance the one - drop rule was enacted in virginia ' s 1924 racial integrity law and in other southern states , in part influenced by the popularity of eugen ##ics and ideas of racial purity . people buried fading memories that many whites had multi ##rac ##ial ancestry . many families were multi ##rac ##ial . similar laws had been proposed but not passed in the late nineteenth century in south carolina and virginia , for instance . after regaining political power in southern states by di ##sen ##fra ##nch ##ising blacks , white democrats passed laws to impose jim crow and racial segregation to restore white supremacy . they maintained these until forced to change in the 1960s and after by enforcement of federal legislation author ##izing oversight of practices to protect the constitutional rights of african americans and other minority citizens .
a continuing , critical labor shortage [SEP] inter ##rac ##ial relationships have had a long history in north america and the united states , beginning with the inter ##mi ##xing of european explorers and soldiers , who took native women as companions . after european settlement increased , traders and fur trap ##pers often married or had unions with women of native tribes . in the 17th century , faced with a continuing , critical labor shortage , colonists primarily in the chesapeake bay colony , imported africans as laborers , sometimes as ind ##ent ##ured servants and , increasingly , as slaves . african slaves were also imported into new york and other northern ports by the dutch and later english . some african slaves were freed by their masters during these early years .
because he has no slave blood in him [SEP] reacting to media criticism of michelle obama during the 2008 presidential election , charles ken ##zie steele , jr . , ceo of the southern christian leadership conference said , " why are they attacking michelle obama , and not really attacking , to that degree , her husband ? because he has no slave blood in him . " he later claimed his comment was intended to be " provocative " but declined to expand on the subject . former secretary of state condo ##lee ##zza rice ( who was famously mistaken for a " recent american immigrant " by french president nicolas sar ##ko ##zy ) , said " descendants of slaves did not get much of a head start , and i think you continue to see some of the effects of that . " she has also rejected an immigrant designation for african americans and instead prefers the term " black " or " white " .

because africans were virtually immune to the old - world diseases [SEP] european colonists created treaties with indigenous american tribes requesting the return of any runaway slaves . for example , in 1726 , the british governor of new york exact ##ed a promise from the iroquois to return all runaway slaves who had joined them . this same promise was extracted from the huron nation in 1764 , and from the delaware nation in 1765 , though there is no record of slaves ever being returned . numerous advertisements requested the return of african americans who had married indigenous americans or who spoke an indigenous american language . the primary exposure that africans and indigenous americans had to each other came through the institution of slavery . indigenous americans learned that africans had what indigenous americans considered ' great medicine ' in their bodies because africans were virtually immune to the old - world diseases that were dec ##imating most native populations . because of this , many tribes encouraged marriage between the two groups , to create stronger , health ##ier children from the unions .
difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with rep ##rod ##ucible purity [SEP] a series of experiments performed from the late 1800s to the early 1900s revealed that diabetes is caused by the absence of a substance normally produced by the pan ##cre ##as . in 1869 , oskar min ##kowski and joseph von mer ##ing found that diabetes could be induced in dogs by surgical removal of the pan ##cre ##as . in 1921 , canadian professor frederick ban ##ting and his student charles best repeated this study , and found that injection ##s of pan ##cre ##atic extract reversed the symptoms produced by pan ##cre ##as removal . soon , the extract was demonstrated to work in people , but development of insulin therapy as a routine medical procedure was delayed by difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with rep ##rod ##ucible purity . the researchers sought assistance from industrial collaborators at eli lilly and co . based on the company ' s experience with large scale purification of biological materials . chemist george walden of eli lilly and company found that careful adjustment of the ph of the extract allowed a relatively pure grade of insulin to be produced . under pressure from toronto university and a potential patent challenge by academic scientists who had independently developed a similar purification method , an agreement was reached for non - exclusive production of insulin by multiple companies . prior to the discovery and widespread availability of insulin therapy the life expect ##ancy of dia ##bet ##ics was only a few months .
addict ##ive properties and abuse potential [SEP] in 1903 hermann emil fischer and joseph von mer ##ing disclosed their discovery that diet ##hyl ##bar ##bit ##uri ##c acid , formed from the reaction of diet ##hyl ##mal ##onic acid , phosphorus ox ##ych ##lor ##ide and ur ##ea , induce ##s sleep in dogs . the discovery was patented and licensed to bayer pharmaceuticals , which marketed the compound under the trade name verona ##l as a sleep aid beginning in 1904 . systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on pot ##ency and duration of action led to the discovery of ph ##eno ##bar ##bit ##al at bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti - ep ##ile ##ptic activity in 1912 . ph ##eno ##bar ##bit ##al was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of ep ##ile ##psy through the 1970s , and as of 2014 , remains on the world health organizations list of essential medications . the 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addict ##ive properties and abuse potential of bar ##bit ##ura ##tes and amp ##het ##amine ##s and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of pre ##scribe ##rs . today , amp ##het ##amine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of attention deficit disorder and ph ##eno ##bar ##bit ##al in the treatment of ep ##ile ##psy .
pathogen ##s [SEP] eh ##rl ##ich ’ s approach of systematically varying the chemical structure of synthetic compounds and measuring the effects of these changes on biological activity was pursued broadly by industrial scientists , including bayer scientists josef k ##lar ##er , fritz mi ##etz ##sch , and gerhard dom ##ag ##k . this work , also based in the testing of compounds available from the german dye industry , led to the development of pro ##nto ##sil , the first representative of the sul ##fo ##nami ##de class of antibiotics . compared to ars ##ph ##ena ##mine , the sul ##fo ##nami ##des had a broader spectrum of activity and were far less toxic , rendering them useful for infections caused by pathogen ##s such as st ##re ##pt ##oco ##cci . in 1939 , dom ##ag ##k received the nobel prize in medicine for this discovery . nonetheless , the dramatic decrease in deaths from infectious diseases that occurred prior to world war ii was primarily the result of improved public health measures such as clean water and less crowded housing , and the impact of anti - in ##fect ##ive drugs and vaccines was significant mainly after world war ii .
contaminated smallpox vaccine and dip ##ht ##her ##ia anti ##to ##xin [SEP] prior to the 20th century drugs were generally produced by small scale manufacturers with little regulatory control over manufacturing or claims of safety and efficacy . to the extent that such laws did exist , enforcement was lax . in the united states , increased regulation of vaccines and other biological drugs was spurred by te ##tan ##us outbreak ##s and deaths caused by the distribution of contaminated smallpox vaccine and dip ##ht ##her ##ia anti ##to ##xin . the bio ##logic ##s control act of 1902 required that federal government grant prem ##ark ##et approval for every biological drug and for the process and facility producing such drugs . this was followed in 1906 by the pure food and drugs act , which forbade the interstate distribution of adult ##erated or mis ##brand ##ed foods and drugs . a drug was considered mis ##brand ##ed if it contained alcohol , mor ##phine , opium , cocaine , or any of several other potentially dangerous or addict ##ive drugs , and if its label failed to indicate the quantity or proportion of such drugs . the government ' s attempts to use the law to prose ##cute manufacturers for making un ##su ##pp ##orted claims of efficacy were under ##cut by a supreme court ruling restricting the federal government ' s enforcement powers to cases of incorrect specification of the drug ' s ingredients .
thought to reduce access to existing medicines [SEP] patents have been criticized in the developing world , as they are thought to reduce access to existing medicines . rec ##on ##ci ##ling patents and universal access to medicine would require an efficient international policy of price discrimination . moreover , under the trips agreement of the world trade organization , countries must allow pharmaceutical products to be patented . in 2001 , the w ##to adopted the doha declaration , which indicates that the trips agreement should be read with the goals of public health in mind , and allows some methods for ci ##rc ##um ##venting pharmaceutical mono ##pol ##ies : via compulsory licensing or parallel imports , even before patent ex ##piration .
the saving of unto ##ld thousands of lives and the all ##ev ##iation of the suffering of millions of victims of hyper ##tension [SEP] in 1952 researchers at ci ##ba discovered the first oral ##ly available va ##so ##di ##lat ##or , hydra ##la ##zine . a major short ##coming of hydra ##la ##zine mono ##therapy was that it lost its effectiveness over time ( ta ##chy ##phy ##la ##xi ##s ) . in the mid - 1950s karl h . bey ##er , james m . sp ##rag ##ue , john e . bae ##r , and frederick c . novel ##lo of mer ##ck and co . discovered and developed ch ##lor ##oth ##ia ##zi ##de , which remains the most widely used anti ##hy ##per ##tens ##ive drug today . this development was associated with a substantial decline in the mortality rate among people with hyper ##tension . the inventor ##s were recognized by a public health las ##ker award in 1975 for " the saving of unto ##ld thousands of lives and the all ##ev ##iation of the suffering of millions of victims of hyper ##tension " .
a new tragedy emerged [SEP] in the u . s . , a push for revisions of the f ##d & c act emerged from congressional hearings led by senator este ##s ke ##fa ##uve ##r of tennessee in 1959 . the hearings covered a wide range of policy issues , including advertising abuses , questionable efficacy of drugs , and the need for greater regulation of the industry . while momentum for new legislation temporarily flag ##ged under extended debate , a new tragedy emerged that under ##sco ##red the need for more comprehensive regulation and provided the driving force for the passage of new laws .
association with grave congenital abnormalities [SEP] the firm continued to pressure kelsey and the agency to approve the application — until november 1961 , when the drug was pulled off the german market because of its association with grave congenital abnormalities . several thousand newborn ##s in europe and elsewhere suffered the ter ##ato ##genic effects of tha ##lid ##omi ##de . though the drug was never approved in the usa , the firm distributed ke ##va ##don to over 1 , 000 physicians there under the guise of investigation ##al use . over 20 , 000 americans received tha ##lid ##omi ##de in this " study , " including 62 ##4 pregnant patients , and about 17 known newborn ##s suffered the effects of the drug .

somewhat res ##ha ##pes the industry ecosystem with biotechnology companies [SEP] some of these estimates also take into account the opportunity cost of investing capital many years before revenues are realized ( see time - value of money ) . because of the very long time needed for discovery , development , and approval of pharmaceuticals , these costs can accumulate to nearly half the total expense . a direct consequence within the pharmaceutical industry value chain is that major pharmaceutical multinational ##s tend to increasingly outs ##our ##ce risks related to fundamental research , which somewhat res ##ha ##pes the industry ecosystem with biotechnology companies playing an increasingly important role , and overall strategies being red ##efined accordingly . some approved drugs , such as those based on re - formulation of an existing active ingredient ( also referred to as line - extensions ) are much less expensive to develop .
adverse effects of tumors , muscle deterioration , and sometimes death [SEP] in 1971 , akira end ##o , a japanese bio ##chemist working for the pharmaceutical company sank ##yo , identified me ##vas ##tat ##in ( ml - 236 ##b ) , a molecule produced by the fungus pen ##ici ##lli ##um ci ##tri ##num , as an inhibitor of hm ##g - coa red ##uc ##tase , a critical enzyme used by the body to produce cho ##les ##terol . animal trials showed very good inhibitor ##y effect as in clinical trials , however a long term study in dogs found toxic effects at higher doses and as a result me ##vas ##tat ##in was believed to be too toxic for human use . me ##vas ##tat ##in was never marketed , because of its adverse effects of tumors , muscle deterioration , and sometimes death in laboratory dogs .
to explore the potential of new drug substances [SEP] often , large multinational corporations exhibit vertical integration , participating in a broad range of drug discovery and development , manufacturing and quality control , marketing , sales , and distribution . smaller organizations , on the other hand , often focus on a specific aspect such as discovering drug candidates or developing formulation ##s . often , collaborative agreements between research organizations and large pharmaceutical companies are formed to explore the potential of new drug substances . more recently , multi - nationals are increasingly relying on contract research organizations to manage drug development .
because medical research and development of drugs to treat such diseases is financially disadvantage ##ous [SEP] there are special rules for certain rare diseases ( " orphan diseases " ) in several major drug regulatory territories . for example , diseases involving fewer than 200 , 000 patients in the united states , or larger populations in certain circumstances are subject to the orphan drug act . because medical research and development of drugs to treat such diseases is financially disadvantage ##ous , companies that do so are rewarded with tax reductions , fee waivers , and market ex ##cl ##us ##ivity on that drug for a limited time ( seven years ) , regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents .
cost is lower [SEP] canadian bit ##umen does not differ substantially from oils such as venezuelan extra - heavy and mexican heavy oil in chemical composition , and the real difficulty is moving the extremely vis ##cous bit ##umen through oil pipeline ##s to the refinery . many modern oil ref ##iner ##ies are extremely sophisticated and can process non - upgraded bit ##umen directly into products such as gasoline , diesel fuel , and refined asphalt without any prep ##ro ##ces ##sing . this is particularly common in areas such as the us gulf coast , where ref ##iner ##ies were designed to process venezuelan and mexican oil , and in areas such as the us midwest where ref ##iner ##ies were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined . given the choice , such heavy oil ref ##iner ##ies usually prefer to buy bit ##umen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower , and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline . by 2015 canadian production and exports of non - upgraded bit ##umen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1 . 3 million barrels ( 210 ##× ##10 ^ 3 m3 ) per day , of which about 65 % was exported to the united states .
weather resistance [SEP] roof ##ing shin ##gles account for most of the remaining asphalt / bit ##umen consumption . other uses include cattle spray ##s , fence - post treatments , and water ##proof ##ing for fabrics . asphalt / bit ##umen is used to make japan black , a lac ##que ##r known especially for its use on iron and steel , and it is also used in paint and marker ink ##s by some graffiti supply companies to increase the weather resistance and per ##man ##ence of the paint or ink , and to make the color much darker . [ citation needed ] asphalt / bit ##umen is also used to seal some al ##kali ##ne batteries during the manufacturing process .
thought it dangerous [SEP] in 1853 , victoria gave birth to her eighth child , leopold , with the aid of the new ana ##est ##hetic , ch ##lor ##of ##or ##m . victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child , beatrice , despite opposition from members of the clergy , who considered it against biblical teaching , and members of the medical profession , who thought it dangerous . victoria may have suffered from post - natal depression after many of her pre ##gnan ##cies . letters from albert to victoria intermittent ##ly complain of her loss of self - control . for example , about a month after leopold ' s birth albert complained in a letter to victoria about her " con ##tin ##uance of h ##yst ##eric ##s " over a " miserable tri ##fle " .

ty ##ph ##oid fever [SEP] in march 1861 , victoria ' s mother died , with victoria at her side . through reading her mother ' s papers , victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply ; she was heart - broken , and blamed con ##roy and le ##h ##zen for " wicked ##ly " est ##rang ##ing her from her mother . to relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief , albert took on most of her duties , despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble . in august , victoria and albert visited their son , the prince of wales , who was attending army man ##oe ##u ##vres near dublin , and spent a few days holiday ##ing in kill ##arney . in november , albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in ireland . appalled , albert travelled to cambridge , where his son was studying , to confront him . by the beginning of december , albert was very un ##well . he was diagnosed with ty ##ph ##oid fever by william jen ##ner , and died on 14 december 1861 . victoria was devastated . she blamed her husband ' s death on worry over the prince of wales ' s phil ##ander ##ing . he had been " killed by that dreadful business " , she said . she entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life . she avoided public appearances , and rarely set foot in london in the following years . her sec ##lusion earned her the nickname " widow of windsor " .
refusal to accept one of his poems [SEP] on 2 march 1882 , roderick maclean , a di ##sg ##run ##tled poet apparently offended by victoria ' s refusal to accept one of his poems , shot at the queen as her carriage left windsor railway station . two school ##boys from eton college struck him with their umbrella ##s , until he was hu ##stle ##d away by a policeman . victoria was outraged when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity , but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack that she said it was " worth being shot at — to see how much one is loved " .
the bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery . [SEP] in 1839 , melbourne resigned after radicals and tori ##es ( both of whom victoria det ##ested ) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of jamaica . the bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery . the queen commissioned a tory , sir robert peel , to form a new ministry . at the time , it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the royal household , who were usually his political allies and their spouse ##s . many of the queen ' s ladies of the bed ##cha ##mber were wives of whig ##s , and peel expected to replace them with wives of tori ##es . in what became known as the bed ##cha ##mber crisis , victoria , advised by melbourne , objected to their removal . peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the queen , and consequently resigned his commission , allowing melbourne to return to office .

fled to exile in england [SEP] internationally , victoria took a keen interest in the improvement of relations between france and britain . she made and hosted several visits between the british royal family and the house of orleans , who were related by marriage through the co ##burg ##s . in 1843 and 1845 , she and albert stayed with king louis philippe i at chateau d ' eu in normandy ; she was the first british or english monarch to visit a french one since the meeting of henry viii of england and francis i of france on the field of the cloth of gold in 152 ##0 . when louis philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844 , he became the first french king to visit a british sovereign . louis philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848 , and fled to exile in england . at the height of a revolutionary scare in the united kingdom in april 1848 , victoria and her family left london for the greater safety of osborne house , a private estate on the isle of wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped . demonstrations by chart ##ists and irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support , and the scare died down without any major disturbances . victoria ' s first visit to ireland in 1849 was a public relations success , but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of irish nationalism .
victoria recalled palmer ##ston to office [SEP] on 14 january 1858 , an italian refugee from britain called or ##sin ##i attempted to assassinate napoleon iii with a bomb made in england . the ensuing diplomatic crisis des ##ta ##bilis ##ed the government , and palmer ##ston resigned . derby was reinstated as prime minister . victoria and albert attended the opening of a new basin at the french military port of cher ##bourg on 5 august 1858 , in an attempt by napoleon iii to reassure britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere . on her return victoria wrote to derby rep ##rim ##and ##ing him for the poor state of the royal navy in comparison to the french one . derby ' s ministry did not last long , and in june 1859 victoria recalled palmer ##ston to office .

" victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice . abdul karim remained in her service until he returned to india with a pension on her death .

concerned that they portrayed victoria as his rival [SEP] in 1830 , the duchess of kent and con ##roy took victoria across the centre of england to visit the malvern hills , stopping at towns and great country houses along the way . similar journeys to other parts of england and wales were taken in 1832 , 1833 , 1834 and 1835 . to the king ' s annoyance , victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops . william compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed victoria as his rival rather than his heiress pre ##sum ##ptive . victoria disliked the trips ; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill , and there was little time for her to rest . she objected on the grounds of the king ' s disapproval , but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy , and forced victoria to continue the tours . at rams ##gate in october 1835 , victoria contracted a severe fever , which con ##roy initially dismissed as a childish pre ##ten ##ce . while victoria was ill , con ##roy and the duchess unsuccessfully badger ##ed her to make con ##roy her private secretary . as a teenager , victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and con ##roy to appoint him to her staff . once queen , she banned him from her presence , but he remained in her mother ' s household .

her father ' s three elder brothers had all died , leaving no surviving legitimate children [SEP] victoria was the daughter of prince edward , duke of kent and st ##rath ##ear ##n , the fourth son of king george iii . both the duke of kent and king george iii died in 1820 , and victoria was raised under close supervision by her german - born mother princess victoria of saxe - co ##burg - sa ##al ##feld . she inherited the throne aged 18 , after her father ' s three elder brothers had all died , leaving no surviving legitimate children . the united kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy , in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power . privately , victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments ; publicly , she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality .
became heiress pre ##sum ##ptive to her next surviving uncle [SEP] at birth , victoria was fifth in the line of succession after her father and his three older brothers : the prince regent , the duke of york , and the duke of clarence ( later william iv ) . the prince regent and the duke of york were estranged from their wives , who were both past child - bearing age , so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children . the dukes of kent and clarence married on the same day 12 months before victoria ' s birth , but both of clarence ' s daughters ( born in 1819 and 1820 respectively ) died as infants . victoria ' s grandfather and father died in 1820 , within a week of each other , and the duke of york died in 1827 . on the death of her uncle george iv in 1830 , victoria became heiress pre ##sum ##ptive to her next surviving uncle , william iv . the regency act 1830 made special provision for the duchess of kent to act as regent in case william died while victoria was still a minor . king william distrust ##ed the duchess ' s capacity to be regent , and in 1836 declared in her presence that he wanted to live until victoria ' s 18th birthday , so that a regency could be avoided .
20 june 1837 , william iv died [SEP] victoria turned 18 on 24 may 1837 , and a regency was avoided . on 20 june 1837 , william iv died at the age of 71 , and victoria became queen of the united kingdom . in her diary she wrote , " i was awoke at 6 o ' clock by ma ##mma , who told me the archbishop of canterbury and lord con ##yn ##gh ##am were here and wished to see me . i got out of bed and went into my sitting - room ( only in my dressing gown ) and alone , and saw them . lord con ##yn ##gh ##am then acquainted me that my poor uncle , the king , was no more , and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning , and consequently that i am queen . " official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as alexa ##nd ##rina victoria , but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again .
was required by social convention [SEP] though queen , as an unmarried young woman victoria was required by social convention to live with her mother , despite their differences over the kensington system and her mother ' s continued reliance on con ##roy . her mother was con ##si ##gned to a remote apartment in buckingham palace , and victoria often refused to see her . when victoria complained to melbourne that her mother ' s close proximity promised " torment for many years " , melbourne sy ##mp ##athi ##sed but said it could be avoided by marriage , which victoria called a " sc ##ho ##cking [ sic ] alternative " . she showed interest in albert ' s education for the future role he would have to play as her husband , but she resisted attempts to rush her into wed ##lock .
he escaped [SEP] on 29 may 1842 , victoria was riding in a carriage along the mall , london , when john francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire ; he escaped . the following day , victoria drove the same route , though faster and with a greater escort , in a deliberate attempt to provoke francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act . as expected , francis shot at her , but he was seized by plain - clothes policemen , and convicted of high treason . on 3 july , two days after francis ' s death sentence was commuted to transportation for life , john william bean also tried to fire a pistol at the queen , but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge . edward oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his ac ##qui ##ttal in 1840 . bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail . in a similar attack in 1849 , unemployed irish ##man william hamilton fired a powder - filled pistol at victoria ' s carriage as it passed along constitution hill , london . in 1850 , the queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex - army officer , robert pat ##e . as victoria was riding in a carriage , pat ##e struck her with his cane , crushing her bonnet and br ##uising her forehead . both hamilton and pat ##e were sentenced to seven years ' transportation .

declared emperor napoleon iii [SEP] russell ' s ministry , though whig , was not favoured by the queen . she found particularly offensive the foreign secretary , lord palmer ##ston , who often acted without consulting the cabinet , the prime minister , or the queen . victoria complained to russell that palmer ##ston sent official dispatch ##es to foreign leaders without her knowledge , but palmer ##ston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative , despite her repeated re ##mons ##tra ##nce ##s . it was only in 1851 that palmer ##ston was removed after he announced the british government ' s approval of president louis - napoleon bonaparte ' s coup in france without consulting the prime minister . the following year , president bonaparte was declared emperor napoleon iii , by which time russell ' s administration had been replaced by a short - lived minority government led by lord derby .
the kensington system [SEP] at the start of her reign victoria was popular , but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court int ##rigue when one of her mother ' s ladies - in - waiting , lady flora hastings , developed an abdominal growth that was widely rum ##oured to be an out - of - wed ##lock pregnancy by sir john con ##roy . victoria believed the rumours . she hated con ##roy , and despised " that odi ##ous lady flora " , because she had con ##sp ##ired with con ##roy and the duchess of kent in the kensington system . at first , lady flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination , until in mid - february she eventually agreed , and was found to be a virgin . con ##roy , the hastings family and the opposition tori ##es organised a press campaign imp ##lica ##ting the queen in the spreading of false rumours about lady flora . when lady flora died in july , the post - mort ##em revealed a large tu ##mour on her liver that had di ##sten ##ded her abdomen . at public appearances , victoria was hissed and je ##ered as " mrs . melbourne " .
acquitted on the grounds of insanity [SEP] during victoria ' s first pregnancy in 1840 , in the first few months of the marriage , 18 - year - old edward oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with prince albert on her way to visit her mother . oxford fired twice , but either both bullets missed or , as he later claimed , the guns had no shot . he was tried for high treason and found guilty , but was acquitted on the grounds of insanity . in the immediate aftermath of the attack , victoria ' s popularity soared , mit ##iga ##ting residual discontent over the hastings affair and the bed ##cha ##mber crisis . her daughter , also named victoria , was born on 21 november 1840 . the queen hated being pregnant , viewed breast - feeding with disgust , and thought newborn babies were ugly . nevertheless , over the following seventeen years , she and albert had a further eight children : albert edward , prince of wales ( b . 1841 ) , alice ( b . 1843 ) , alfred ( b . 1844 ) , helena ( b . 1846 ) , louise ( b . 1848 ) , arthur ( b . 1850 ) , leopold ( b . 1853 ) and beatrice ( b . 1857 ) .

his budget was defeated [SEP] victoria was pleased when gladstone resigned in 1885 after his budget was defeated . she thought his government was " the worst i have ever had " , and blamed him for the death of general gordon at k ##hart ##oum . gladstone was replaced by lord salisbury . salisbury ' s government only lasted a few months , however , and victoria was forced to recall gladstone , whom she referred to as a " half crazy & really in many ways ridiculous old man " . gladstone attempted to pass a bill granting ireland home rule , but to victoria ' s glee it was defeated . in the ensuing election , gladstone ' s party lost to salisbury ' s and the government switched hands again .

free ##mas ##on ##ry was not a religion [SEP] a dispute during the lausanne congress of supreme councils of 1875 prompted the grand orient de france to commission a report by a protestant pastor which concluded that , as free ##mas ##on ##ry was not a religion , it should not require a religious belief . the new constitution ##s read , " its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity " , the existence of god and the immortality of the soul being struck out . it is possible that the immediate objections of the united grand lodge of england were at least partly motivated by the political tension between france and britain at the time . the result was the withdrawal of recognition of the grand orient of france by the united grand lodge of england , a situation that continues today .
parliamentary proclamation [SEP] in 1799 , english free ##mas ##on ##ry almost came to a halt due to parliamentary proclamation . in the wake of the french revolution , the unlawful societies act 1799 banned any meetings of groups that required their members to take an oath or obligation . the grand masters of both the modern ##s and the anti ##ents grand lodges called on prime minister william pitt ( who was not a free ##mas ##on ) and explained to him that free ##mas ##on ##ry was a supporter of the law and lawful ##ly constituted authority and was much involved in charitable work . as a result , free ##mas ##on ##ry was specifically exempt ##ed from the terms of the act , provided that each private lodge ' s secretary placed with the local " clerk of the peace " a list of the members of his lodge once a year . this continued until 1967 when the obligation of the provision was res ##cin ##ded by parliament .
provides a forum for most of these grand lodges and grand orient ##s worldwide [SEP] the majority of free ##mas ##on ##ry considers the liberal ( continental ) strand to be irregular , and thus with ##hold recognition . for the continental lodges , however , having a different approach to free ##mas ##on ##ry was not a reason for se ##ver ##ing masonic ties . in 1961 , an umbrella organisation , centre de liaison et d ' information des pu ##issa ##nce ##s macon ##ni ##ques sign ##ata ##ire ##s de l ' app ##el de strasbourg ( clips ##as ) was set up , which today provides a forum for most of these grand lodges and grand orient ##s worldwide . included in the list of over 70 grand lodges and grand orient ##s are representatives of all three of the above categories , including mixed and women ' s organisations . the united grand lodge of england does not communicate with any of these jurisdictions , and expects its allies to follow suit . this creates the distinction between anglo - american and continental free ##mas ##on ##ry .
teaches a naturalist ##ic dei ##stic religion [SEP] the denomination with the longest history of objection to free ##mas ##on ##ry is the roman catholic church . the objections raised by the roman catholic church are based on the all ##ega ##tion that masonry teaches a naturalist ##ic dei ##stic religion which is in conflict with church doctrine . a number of papal pro ##no ##unce ##ments have been issued against free ##mas ##on ##ry . the first was pope clement xii ' s in eminent ##i ap ##ost ##ola ##tus , 28 april 1738 ; the most recent was pope leo xiii ' s ab apostolic ##i , 15 october 1890 . the 1917 code of canon law explicitly declared that joining free ##mas ##on ##ry en ##tail ##ed automatic ex ##com ##mun ##ication , and banned books favour ##ing free ##mas ##on ##ry .
constitutes an act of ap ##osta ##sy [SEP] in 1933 , the orthodox church of greece officially declared that being a free ##mas ##on constitutes an act of ap ##osta ##sy and thus , until he rep ##ents , the person involved with free ##mas ##on ##ry cannot part ##ake of the eu ##cha ##rist . this has been generally affirmed throughout the whole eastern orthodox church . the orthodox critique of free ##mas ##on ##ry agrees with both the roman catholic and protestant versions : " free ##mas ##on ##ry cannot be at all compatible with christianity as far as it is a secret organisation , acting and teaching in mystery and secret and dei ##fying rational ##ism . "
the other grand lodges will have to choose between them [SEP] exclusive jurisdiction is a concept whereby only one grand lodge will be recognised in any geographical area . if two grand lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area , the other grand lodges will have to choose between them , and they may not all decide to recognise the same one . ( in 1849 , for example , the grand lodge of new york split into two rival factions , each claiming to be the legitimate grand lodge . other grand lodges had to choose between them until the sc ##hism was healed . ) exclusive jurisdiction can be waived when the two over - lap ##ping grand lodges are themselves in ami ##ty and agree to share jurisdiction ( for example , since the grand lodge of connecticut is in ami ##ty with the prince hall grand lodge of connecticut , the principle of exclusive jurisdiction does not apply , and other grand lodges may recognise both ) .
refusal of early american lodges to admit african - americans [SEP] prince hall free ##mas ##on ##ry exists because of the refusal of early american lodges to admit african - americans . in 1775 , an african - american named prince hall , along with fourteen other african - americans , was initiated into a british military lodge with a warrant from the grand lodge of ireland , having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in boston . when the military lodge left north america , those fifteen men were given the authority to meet as a lodge , but not to initiate mason ##s . in 1784 , these individuals obtained a warrant from the premier grand lodge of england ( g ##le ) and formed african lodge , number 45 ##9 . when the u ##gle was formed in 1813 , all u . s . - based lodges were stricken from their rolls – due largely to the war of 1812 . thus , separated from both u ##gle and any concord ##antly recognised u . s . grand lodge , african lodge re - titled itself as the african lodge , number 1 – and became a de facto " grand lodge " ( this lodge is not to be confused with the various grand lodges on the continent of africa ) . as with the rest of u . s . free ##mas ##on ##ry , prince hall free ##mas ##on ##ry soon grew and organised on a grand lodge system for each state .

allow her lodge to rejoin their grand lodge [SEP] maria der ##ais ##mes was initiated into free ##mas ##on ##ry in 1882 , then resigned to allow her lodge to rejoin their grand lodge . having failed to achieve acceptance from any masonic governing body , she and georges martin started a mixed masonic lodge that actually worked masonic ritual . annie be ##sant spread the phenomenon to the english speaking world . disagreements over ritual led to the formation of exclusively female bodies of free ##mas ##ons in england , which spread to other countries . meanwhile , the french had re - invented adoption as an all - female lodge in 1901 , only to cast it aside again in 1935 . the lodges , however , continued to meet , which gave rise , in 1959 , to a body of women pr ##act ##ising continental free ##mas ##on ##ry .
rebuild the temple of solomon in jerusalem [SEP] many islamic anti - masonic arguments are closely tied to both anti ##se ##mit ##ism and anti - zion ##ism , though other criticisms are made such as linking free ##mas ##on ##ry to al - mas ##ih ad - da ##j ##jal ( the false messiah ) . some muslim anti - mason ##s argue that free ##mas ##on ##ry promotes the interests of the jews around the world and that one of its aims is to destroy the al - a ##q ##sa mosque in order to rebuild the temple of solomon in jerusalem . in article 28 of its covenant , hamas states that free ##mas ##on ##ry , rotary , and other similar groups " work in the interest of zion ##ism and according to its instructions . . . "
imp ##ede iraq ' s nuclear weapons program [SEP] on 7 june 1981 , the israeli air force destroyed iraq ' s sole nuclear reactor , in order to imp ##ede iraq ' s nuclear weapons program . the reactor was under construction just outside baghdad . following a series of pl ##o attacks in 1982 , israel invaded lebanon that year to destroy the bases from which the pl ##o launched attacks and missiles into northern israel . in the first six days of fighting , the israelis destroyed the military forces of the pl ##o in lebanon and decisive ##ly defeated the syrian ##s . an israeli government inquiry – the ka ##han commission – would later hold begin , sharon and several israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the sa ##bra and sha ##tila massacre . in 1985 , israel responded to a palestinian terrorist attack in cyprus by bombing the pl ##o headquarters in tunis . israel withdrew from most of lebanon in 1986 , but maintained a border ##land buffer zone in southern lebanon until 2000 , from where israeli forces engaged in conflict with hezbollah .
this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments [SEP] the water , sanitation and hygiene ( w ##sh ) program of the gates foundation was launched in mid - 2005 as a " learning initiative , " and became a full - fledged program under the global development division in early 2010 . the foundation has since 2005 undertaken a wide range of efforts in the wash sector involving research , experimentation , reflection , advocacy , and field implementation . in 2009 , the foundation decided to ref ##oc ##us its wash effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor , using non - pipe ##d sanitation services ( i . e . without the use of sewer ##s ) , and less on water supply . this was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments , and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments .
the emotional and personal debate about abortion is threatening to get in the way of the life ##sa ##ving consensus regarding basic family planning [SEP] melinda gates has stated that the foundation " has decided not to fund abortion " . in response to questions about this decision , gates stated in a june 2014 blog post that she " struggle [ s ] with the issue " and that " the emotional and personal debate about abortion is threatening to get in the way of the life ##sa ##ving consensus regarding basic family planning " . up to 2013 , the bill & melinda gates foundation provided $ 71 million to planned parent ##hood , the primary u . s . abortion provider , and affiliated organizations .
they may marginal ##ize researchers who do not support gates ' pre ##de ##ter ##mined policy preferences [SEP] the k - 12 and higher education reform programs of the gates foundation have been criticized by some education professionals , parents , and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginal ##ize researchers who do not support gates ' pre ##de ##ter ##mined policy preferences . several gates - backed policies such as small schools , charter schools , and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disrupt ##ive , but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm . peer reviewed scientific studies at stanford find that charter schools do not systematically improve student performance
had quad ##rup ##led [SEP] in 1860 , montevideo had 57 , 91 ##3 inhabitants including a number of people of african origin who had been brought as slaves and had gained their freedom around the middle of the century . by 1880 , the population had quad ##rup ##led , mainly because of the great european immigration . in 1908 , its population had grown massive ##ly to 309 , 331 inhabitants . in the course of the 20th century the city continued to receive large numbers of european immigrants , especially spanish and italian , followed by french , germans or dutch , english or irish , polish , greek , hungarians , russians , croats , lebanese , armenians , and jews of various origins . the last wave of immigrants occurred between 1945 and 1955 .
a major storm [SEP] the port on montevideo bay is one of the reasons the city was founded . it gives natural protection to ships , although two jett ##ies now further protect the harbour entrance from waves . this natural port is competitive with the other great port of rio de la plata , buenos aires . the main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930 . these six decades saw the construction of the port ' s first wooden pier , several warehouses in la ag ##ua ##da , the north and south ram ##bla , a river port , a new pier , the dr ##edge ##d river basin and the la te ##ja refinery . a major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city ' s engineering works . since the second half of the 20th century , physical changes have ceased , and since that time the area has degraded due to national economic st ##ag ##nation .
selective breeding for fast growth , egg - laying ability , conform ##ation , plumage and doc ##ility took place [SEP] the domestic ##ation of poultry took place several thousand years ago . this may have originally been as a result of people hatch ##ing and rear ##ing young birds from eggs collected from the wild , but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity . domestic ##ated chickens may have been used for cock ##fighting at first and qu ##ail kept for their songs , but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive - bred source of food . selective breeding for fast growth , egg - laying ability , conform ##ation , plumage and doc ##ility took place over the centuries , and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors . although some birds are still kept in small flock ##s in extensive systems , most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises . poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and , along with eggs , provides nutritional ##ly beneficial food containing high - quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat . all poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning .
can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of 3 . 5 kg ( 7 . 7 lb ) in 44 days [SEP] it is widely agreed that the mall ##ard ( ana ##s pl ##at ##yr ##hy ##nch ##os ) is the ancestor of all breeds of domestic duck ( with the exception of the mu ##sco ##vy duck ( cai ##rina mo ##sch ##ata ) , which is not closely related to other ducks ) . ducks are farm ##ed mainly for their meat , eggs , and down . as is the case with chickens , various breeds have been developed , selected for egg - laying ability , fast growth , and a well - covered car ##case . the most common commercial breed in the united kingdom and the united states is the pe ##kin duck , which can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of 3 . 5 kg ( 7 . 7 lb ) in 44 days . in the western world , ducks are not as popular as chickens , because the latter produce larger quantities of white , lean meat and are easier to keep intensive ##ly , making the price of chicken meat lower than that of duck meat . while popular in haute cuisine , duck appears less frequently in the mass - market food industry . however , things are different in the east . ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herd ##ed in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in harvested rice fields and other wet environments .

they deposit fat sub ##cut ##aneous ##ly , although this fat contains mostly mono ##un ##sat ##ura ##ted fatty acids [SEP] domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks , an upright posture , and large bodies with broad rear ends . the grey ##lag - derived birds are large and flesh ##y and used for meat , while the chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production . the fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments . they for ##age on grass and weeds , supplement ##ing this with small invertebrates , and one of the attractions of rear ##ing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass - based system . they are very greg ##ario ##us and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk . the chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and can be used as a guard animal to warn of intruder ##s . the flesh of meat geese is dark - coloured and high in protein , but they deposit fat sub ##cut ##aneous ##ly , although this fat contains mostly mono ##un ##sat ##ura ##ted fatty acids . the birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks . between these ages , problems with dressing the car ##case occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers .
japanese breeders began to selective ##ly breed for increased egg production . [SEP] in the early 20th century , japanese breeders began to selective ##ly breed for increased egg production . by 1940 , the qu ##ail egg industry was flourishing , but the events of world war ii led to the complete loss of qu ##ail lines bred for their song type , as well as almost all of those bred for egg production . after the war , the few surviving domestic ##ated qu ##ail were used to rebuild the industry , and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population . modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year and countries such as japan , india , china , italy , russia , and the united states have established commercial japanese qu ##ail farming industries . japanese qu ##ail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics , embryo ##logy , nutrition , physiology , pathology , and toxicity studies . these qu ##ail are closely related to the common qu ##ail , and many young hybrid birds are released into the wild each year to rep ##len ##ish d ##wind ##ling wild populations .

the microscopic regular structure of intra ##cellular muscle fi ##bri ##ls which can di ##ff ##rac ##t light and produce ir ##ides ##cent colours [SEP] dark meat , which av ##ian my ##ologists refer to as " red muscle " , is used for sustained activity — chiefly walking , in the case of a chicken . the dark colour comes from the protein my ##og ##lo ##bin , which plays a key role in oxygen up ##take and storage within cells . white muscle , in contrast , is suitable only for short bursts of activity such as , for chickens , flying . thus , the chicken ' s leg and thigh meat are dark , while its breast meat ( which makes up the primary flight muscles ) is white . other birds with breast muscle more suitable for sustained flight , such as ducks and geese , have red muscle ( and therefore dark meat ) throughout . some cuts of meat including poultry expose the microscopic regular structure of intra ##cellular muscle fi ##bri ##ls which can di ##ff ##rac ##t light and produce ir ##ides ##cent colours , an optical phenomenon sometimes called structural colour ##ation .
palace was seldom used , even neglected [SEP] widowed in 1861 , the grief - stricken queen withdrew from public life and left buckingham palace to live at windsor castle , bal ##moral castle and osborne house . for many years the palace was seldom used , even neglected . in 1864 , a note was found pinned to the fence of buckingham palace , saying : " these commanding premises to be let or sold , in consequence of the late o ##cc ##up ##ant ' s declining business . " eventually , public opinion forced the queen to return to london , though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible . court functions were still held at windsor castle , presided over by the so ##mbre queen habit ##ually dressed in mourning black , while buckingham palace remained shutter ##ed for most of the year .
the remaining energy is converted into heat . [SEP] inca ##nde ##scent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting ; inca ##nde ##scent bulbs convert less than 5 % of the energy they use into visible light , with standard light bulbs averaging about 2 . 2 % . the remaining energy is converted into heat . the luminous efficacy of a typical inca ##nde ##scent bulb is 16 lu ##men ##s per watt , compared with 60 l ##m / w for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 l ##m / w for some white led lamps . some applications of the inca ##nde ##scent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the fi ##lam ##ent . such applications include inc ##uba ##tors , brooding boxes for poultry , heat lights for rep ##tile tanks , infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes , lava lamps , and the easy - ba ##ke oven toy . inca ##nde ##scent bulbs typically have short lifetime ##s compared with other types of lighting ; around 1 , 000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10 , 000 hours for compact fluorescent ##s and 30 , 000 hours for lighting led ##s .
' parchment ##ised thread ' [SEP] with the help of charles ste ##ar ##n , an expert on vacuum pumps , in 1878 , swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb black ##ening . this received a british patent in 1880 . [ dubious – discuss ] on 18 december 1878 , a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the newcastle chemical society , and swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 january 1879 . it was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the literary and philosophical society of newcastle upon tyne on 3 february 1879 . these lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender fi ##lam ##ent . thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current , so they were not commercially practical , although they did fur ##nish a demonstration of the possibilities of inca ##nde ##scent lighting with relatively high vacuum , a carbon conductor , and platinum lead - in wires . besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical , they had a very short lifetime . swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon fi ##lam ##ent and the means of attach ##ing its ends . he devised a method of treating cotton to produce ' parchment ##ised thread ' and obtained british patent 49 ##33 in 1880 . from this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in england . his house was the first in the world to be lit by a light ##bu ##lb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power . in 1878 the home of lord armstrong at cr ##ags ##ide was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity . in the early 1880s he had started his company . in 1881 , the savoy theatre in the city of westminster , london was lit by swan inca ##nde ##scent light ##bu ##lb ##s , which was the first theatre , and the first public building in the world , to be lit entirely by electricity .
the continuous black ##body spectrum emitted from an inca ##nde ##scent light - bulb fi ##lam ##ent [SEP] although in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt , inca ##nde ##scent light bulbs have an advantage in applications where accurate color reproduction is important , since the continuous black ##body spectrum emitted from an inca ##nde ##scent light - bulb fi ##lam ##ent yields near - perfect color rendition , with a color rendering index of 100 ( the best possible ) . white - balancing is still required to avoid too " warm " or " cool " colors , but this is a simple process that requires only the color temperature in kelvin as input for modern , digital visual reproduction equipment such as video or still cameras unless it is completely automated . the color - rendering performance of inca ##nde ##scent lights cannot be matched by led ##s or fluorescent lights , although they can offer satisfactory performance for non - critical applications such as home lighting . white - balancing such lights is therefore more complicated , requiring additional adjustments to reduce for example green - mage ##nta color casts , and even when properly white - balanced , the color reproduction will not be perfect .
due to the discrete spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum [SEP] there are many non - inca ##nde ##scent light sources , such as the fluorescent lamp , high - intensity discharge lamps and led lamps , which have higher luminous efficiency , and some have been designed to be retro ##fi ##tted in fixtures for inca ##nde ##scent lights . these devices produce light by lu ##mine ##sc ##ence . these lamps produce discrete spectral lines and do not have the broad " tail " of invisible infrared emissions . by careful selection of which electron energy level transitions are used , and fluorescent coating ##s which modify the spectral distribution , the spectrum emitted can be tuned to mimic the appearance of inca ##nde ##scent sources , or other different color temperatures of white light . due to the discrete spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum , the light is not ideal for applications such as photography and cinematography .
a more gentle and evenly distributed light [SEP] most light bulbs have either clear or coated glass . the coated glass bulbs have a white powder ##y substance on the inside called ka ##olin . ka ##olin , or ka ##olin ##ite , is a white , chalk ##y clay in a very fine powder form , that is blown in and electro ##static ##ally deposited on the interior of the bulb . it diffuse ##s the light emitted from the fi ##lam ##ent , producing a more gentle and evenly distributed light . manufacturers may add pigment ##s to the ka ##olin to adjust the characteristics of the final light emitted from the bulb . ka ##olin diffuse ##d bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light . other kinds of colored bulbs are also made , including the various colors used for " party bulbs " , christmas tree lights and other decorative lighting . these are created by coloring the glass with a do ##pan ##t ; which is often a metal like cobalt ( blue ) or ch ##rom ##ium ( green ) . neo ##dy ##mium - containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural - appearing light .
conducts heat from the fi ##lam ##ent , thereby cooling the fi ##lam ##ent [SEP] while in ##ert gas reduces fi ##lam ##ent eva ##por ##ation , it also conducts heat from the fi ##lam ##ent , thereby cooling the fi ##lam ##ent and reducing efficiency . at constant pressure and temperature , the thermal conduct ##ivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules . higher molecular weight gas ##ses have lower thermal conduct ##ivity , because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher . x ##eno ##n gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight , but is also more expensive , so its use is limited to smaller lamps .

the oxygen attacks the tung ##sten metal , and the resulting tung ##sten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp . [SEP] a very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening . water vapor di ##sso ##cia ##tes into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot fi ##lam ##ent . the oxygen attacks the tung ##sten metal , and the resulting tung ##sten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp . hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide , reforming water vapor and continuing this water cycle . the equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500 , 000 lamps will significantly increase darkening . small amounts of substances such as z ##ir ##con ##ium are placed within the lamp as a get ##ter to react with any oxygen that may ba ##ke out of the lamp components during operation .
they can run hotter for the same lifetime before the fi ##lam ##ent eva ##por ##ates . [SEP] lamps designed for different voltage ##s have different luminous efficacy . for example , a 100 - watt , 120 - vol ##t lamp will produce about 17 . 1 lu ##men ##s per watt . a lamp with the same rated lifetime but designed for 230 v would produce only around 12 . 8 lu ##men ##s per watt , and a similar lamp designed for 30 vol ##ts ( train lighting ) would produce as much as 19 . 8 lu ##men ##s per watt . lower voltage lamps have a thicker fi ##lam ##ent , for the same power rating . they can run hotter for the same lifetime before the fi ##lam ##ent eva ##por ##ates .
penalties [SEP] the club ' s success in the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century owed a great deal to the 1996 appointment of ars ##ene wen ##ger as manager . wen ##ger brought new tactics , a new training regime and several foreign players who complement ##ed the existing english talent . arsenal won a second league and cup double in 1997 – 98 and a third in 2001 – 02 . in addition , the club reached the final of the 1999 – 2000 uefa cup ( losing on penalties to gala ##tas ##ara ##y ) , were victorious in the 2003 and 2005 fa cups , and won the premier league in 2003 – 04 without losing a single match , an achievement which earned the side the nickname " the invincible ##s " . the feat came within a run of 49 league matches unbeaten from 7 may 2003 to 24 october 2004 , a national record .
broadcast live on radio [SEP] arsenal have appeared in a number of media " first ##s " . on 22 january 1927 , their match at high ##bury against sheffield united was the first english league match to be broadcast live on radio . a decade later , on 16 september 1937 , an exhibition match between arsenal ' s first team and the reserves was the first football match in the world to be televised live . arsenal also featured in the first edition of the bbc ' s match of the day , which screened highlights of their match against liverpool at an ##field on 22 august 1964 . bs ##ky ##b ' s coverage of arsenal ' s january 2010 match against manchester united was the first live public broadcast of a sports event on 3d television .
social norms [SEP] humans have shown extreme in ##vent ##ive ##ness in devi ##sing clothing solutions to environmental hazards . examples include : space suits , air conditioned clothing , armor , diving suits , swim ##suit ##s , bee - keeper gear , motorcycle leather ##s , high - visibility clothing , and other pieces of protective clothing . meanwhile , the distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear - cut — since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design . wearing clothes also has social implications . they cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered , act as a form of ad ##orn ##ment , and serve other social purposes .
formal ##deh ##yde [SEP] a resin used for making non - wr ##ink ##le shirts releases formal ##deh ##yde , which could cause contact der ##mat ##itis for some people ; no disclosure requirements exist , and in 2008 the u . s . government accountability office tested formal ##deh ##yde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non - wr ##ink ##le shirts and pants . in 1999 , a study of the effect of washing on the formal ##deh ##yde levels found that after 6 months after washing , 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 pp ##m , which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure .
worth more than labor [SEP] in past times , men ##ding was an art . a met ##ic ##ulous tailor or seam ##st ##ress could men ##d rip ##s with thread rave ##led from hem ##s and seam edges so skill ##fully that the tear was practically invisible . when the raw material – cloth – was worth more than labor , it made sense to ex ##pen ##d labor in saving it . today clothing is considered a con ##sum ##able item . mass - manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it . many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time men ##ding . the th ##rift ##y still replace zipper ##s and buttons and se ##w up ripped hem ##s .
wartime travel restrictions [SEP] the cubs enjoyed one more pennant at the close of world war ii , finishing 98 – 56 . due to the wartime travel restrictions , the first three games of the 1945 world series were played in detroit , where the cubs won two games , including a one - hitter by claude pass ##eau , and the final four were played at wr ##ig ##ley . in game 4 of the series , the curse of the billy goat was allegedly laid upon the cubs when p . k . wr ##ig ##ley ejected billy si ##ani ##s , who had come to game 4 with two box seat tickets , one for him and one for his goat . they parade ##d around for a few innings , but wr ##ig ##ley demanded the goat leave the park due to its unpleasant odor . upon his e ##ject ##ion , mr . si ##ani ##s uttered , " the cubs , they ain ' t gonna win no more . " the cubs lost game 4 , lost the series , and have not been back since . it has also been said by many that si ##ani ##s put a " curse " on the cubs , apparently preventing the team from playing in the world series . after losing the 1945 world series to the detroit tigers , the cubs finished with winning seasons the next two years , but those teams did not enter post - season play .
due to injuries to rick re ##us ##chel ( 5 – 5 ) and sanders ##on [SEP] the team ' s commitment to contend was complete when green made a mid ##sea ##son deal on june 15 to shore up the starting rotation due to injuries to rick re ##us ##chel ( 5 – 5 ) and sanders ##on . the deal brought 1979 nl rookie of the year pitcher rick su ##tc ##liffe from the cleveland indians . joe carter ( who was with the triple - a iowa cubs at the time ) and center fielder mel hall were sent to cleveland for su ##tc ##liffe and back - up catcher ron has ##sey ( . 333 with cubs in 1984 ) . su ##tc ##liffe ( 5 – 5 with the indians ) immediately joined sanders ##on ( 8 – 5 3 . 14 ) , ec ##kers ##ley ( 10 – 8 3 . 03 ) , steve trout ( 13 – 7 3 . 41 ) and dick ruth ##ven ( 6 – 10 5 . 04 ) in the starting rotation . su ##tc ##liffe proceeded to go 16 – 1 for cubs and capture the cy young award .
wr ##ig ##ley field did not yet have lights [SEP] the confusion may stem from the fact that major league baseball did decide that , should the cubs make it to the world series , the american league winner would have home field advantage unless the cubs hosted home games at an alternate site since the cubs home field of wr ##ig ##ley field did not yet have lights . rumor was the cubs could hold home games across town at com ##isk ##ey park , home of the american league ' s chicago white sox . rather than hold any games in the cross town rival sox park , the cubs made arrangements with the august a . busch , owner of the st . louis cardinals , to use busch stadium in st . louis as the cubs " home field " for the world series . this was approved by major league baseball and would have enabled the cubs to host games 1 and 2 , along with games 6 and 7 if necessary . at the time home field advantage was rotated between each league . odd numbered years the al had home field advantage . even numbered years the nl had home field advantage . in the 1982 world series the st . louis cardinals of the nl had home field advantage . in the 1983 world series the baltimore orioles of the al had home field advantage .
take care of his sick mother [SEP] rookie star ##lin castro debuted in early may ( 2010 ) as the starting shortstop . however , the club played poorly in the early season , finding themselves 10 games under . 500 at the end of june . in addition , long - time ace carlos za ##mb ##rano was pulled from a game against the white sox on june 25 after a ti ##rade and shoving match with der ##rek lee , and was suspended indefinitely by jim hen ##dry , who called the conduct " unacceptable . " on august 22 , lou pin ##iel ##la , who had already announced his retirement at the end of the season , announced that he would leave the cubs prematurely to take care of his sick mother . mike quad ##e took over as the interim manager for the final 37 games of the year . despite being well out of playoff contention the cubs went 24 – 13 under quad ##e , the best record in baseball during that 37 game stretch , earning quad ##e to have the interim tag removed on october 19 .

north korea invaded south korea [SEP] the korean war ( in south korean hangul : ᄒ ##ᅡ ##ᆫ ##ᄀ ##ᅮ ##ᆨ ##ᄌ ##ᅥ ##ᆫ ##ᄌ ##ᅢ ##ᆼ , han ##ja : [UNK] 國 [UNK] [UNK] , hang ##uk je ##on ##ja ##eng , " korean war " ; in north korean cho ##sun ##gul : ᄌ ##ᅩ ##ᄀ ##ᅮ ##ᆨ ##ᄒ ##ᅢ ##ᄇ ##ᅡ ##ᆼ ##ᄌ ##ᅥ ##ᆫ ##ᄌ ##ᅢ ##ᆼ , jo ##gu ##k ha ##eb ##ang je ##on ##ja ##eng , " father ##land liberation war " ; 25 june 1950 – 27 july 1953 ) [ a ] was started when north korea invaded south korea . the united nations , with united states as the principal force , came to aid of south korea . china , along with assistance from soviet union , came to aid of north korea . the war arose from the division of korea at the end of world war ii and from the global tensions of the cold war that developed immediately afterwards .
it was communist [SEP] on 8 september 1945 , u . s . lt . gen . john r . hodge arrived in inch ##eon to accept the japanese surrender south of the 38th parallel . appointed as military governor , general hodge directly controlled south korea as head of the united states army military government in korea ( usa ##mg ##ik 1945 – 48 ) . he established control by restoring to power the key japanese colonial administrators , but in the face of korean protests he quickly reversed this decision . the usa ##mg ##ik refused to recognize the provisional government of the short - lived people ' s republic of korea ( pr ##k ) because it suspected it was communist .
it would not be fair [SEP] citing the inability of the joint commission to make progress , the u . s . government decided to hold an election under united nations auspices with the aim of creating an independent korea . the soviet authorities and the korean communists refused to co - operate on the grounds it would not be fair , and many south korean politicians also boycott ##ed it . a general election was held in the south on 10 may 1948 . it was marred by terrorism and sabotage resulting in 600 deaths . north korea held parliamentary elections three months later on 25 august .
chinese support [SEP] the north korean contributions to the chinese communist victory were not forgotten after the creation of the people ' s republic of china in 1949 . as a token of gratitude , between 50 , 000 and 70 , 000 korean veterans that served in the pl ##a were sent back along with their weapons , and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of south korea . china promised to support the north koreans in the event of a war against south korea . the chinese support created a deep division between the korean communists , and kim il - sung ' s authority within the communist party was challenged by the chinese faction led by pak il - yu , who was later purge ##d by kim .
south korean agents had learned about the plans [SEP] on 7 june 1950 , kim il - sung called for a korea - wide election on 5 – 8 august 1950 and a consultative conference in ha ##ej ##u on 15 – 17 june 1950 . on 11 june , the north sent three diplomats to the south , as a peace overture that r ##hee rejected . on 21 june , kim il - sung revised his war plan to involve general attack across the 38th parallel , rather than a limited operation in the on ##g ##jin peninsula . kim was concerned that south korean agents had learned about the plans and south korean forces were strengthening their defenses . stalin agreed to this change of plan .
us policy toward japan [SEP] one face ##t of the changing attitude toward korea and whether to get involved was japan . especially after the fall of china to the communists , u . s . east asian experts saw japan as the critical counter ##weight to the soviet union and china in the region . while there was no united states policy that dealt with south korea directly as a national interest , its proximity to japan increased the importance of south korea . said kim : " the recognition that the security of japan required a non - hostile korea led directly to president truman ' s decision to intervene . . . the essential point . . . is that the american response to the north korean attack stemmed from considerations of us policy toward japan . "
advisers believed the north koreans could be stopped by air and naval power [SEP] a major consideration was the possible soviet reaction in the event that the us intervened . the truman administration was fr ##et ##ful that a war in korea was a diversion ##ary assault that would es ##cala ##te to a general war in europe once the united states committed in korea . at the same time , " [ t ] here was no suggestion from anyone that the united nations or the united states could back away from [ the conflict ] " . yugoslavia – a possible soviet target because of the tito - stalin split — was vital to the defense of italy and greece , and the country was first on the list of the national security council ' s post - north korea invasion list of " chief danger spots " . truman believed if aggression went un ##che ##cked a chain reaction would be initiated that would marginal ##ize the united nations and encourage communist aggression elsewhere . the un security council approved the use of force to help the south koreans and the us immediately began using what air and naval forces that were in the area to that end . the administration still refrain ##ed from committing on the ground because some advisers believed the north koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone .
u . s . navy no longer had the warships [SEP] as an initial response , truman called for a naval blockade of north korea , and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only ' on paper ' , since the u . s . navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request . in fact , because of the extensive defense cuts and the emphasis placed on building a nuclear bomber force , none of the services were in a position to make a robust response with conventional military strength . general omar bradley , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , was faced with re - organizing and deploy ##ing an american military force that was a shadow of its world war ii counterpart . the impact of the truman administration ' s defense budget cut ##backs were now keen ##ly felt , as american troops fought a series of costly rear ##guard actions . lacking sufficient anti - tank weapons , artillery or armor , they were driven back down the korean peninsula to pu ##san . in a postwar analysis of the un ##pre ##par ##ed ##ness of u . s . army forces deployed to korea during the summer and fall of 1950 , army major general floyd l . parks stated that " many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action , unit by unit , man by man . . . [ t ] hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat . . . does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a pre ##dic ##ament . "

to counter a possible u . s . deployment [SEP] although kim ' s early successes had led him to predict that he would end the war by the end of august , chinese leaders were more pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic . to counter a possible u . s . deployment , zhou en ##lai secured a soviet commitment to have the soviet union support chinese forces with air cover , and deployed 260 , 000 soldiers along the korean border , under the command of gao gang . zhou commanded cha ##i cheng ##wen to conduct a topographic ##al survey of korea , and directed lei ying ##fu , zhou ' s military advisor in korea , to analyze the military situation in korea . lei concluded that macarthur would most likely attempt a landing at inch ##eon . after con ##fer ##ring with mao that this would be macarthur ' s most likely strategy , zhou brief ##ed soviet and north korean advisers of lei ' s findings , and issued orders to chinese army commanders deployed on the korean border to prepare for american naval activity in the korea strait .

in search of job opportunities [SEP] xi ##amen dialect , sometimes known as am ##oy , is the main dialect spoken in the chinese city of xi ##amen and its surrounding regions of tong ' an and xiang ' an , both of which are now included in the greater xi ##amen area . this dialect developed in the late ming dynasty when xi ##amen was increasingly taking over quan ##zhou ' s position as the main port of trade in southeastern china . quan ##zhou traders began travelling southward ##s to xi ##amen to carry on their businesses while zhang ##zhou peasants began traveling northwards to xi ##amen in search of job opportunities . it is at this time when a need for a common language arose . the quan ##zhou and zhang ##zhou varieties are similar in many ways ( as can be seen from the common place of henan lu ##oya ##ng where they originated ) , but due to differences in accents , communication can be a problem . quan ##zhou businessmen considered their speech to be the prestige accent and considered zhang ##zhou ' s to be a village dialect . over the centuries , dialect level ##ing occurred and the two speeches mixed to produce the am ##oy dialect .
is forced out of the match [SEP] in matches with multiple competitors , an elimination system may be used . any wrestler who has a fall scored against them is forced out of the match , and the match continues until only one remains . however , it is much more common when more than two wrestlers are involved to simply go one fall , with the one scoring the fall , regardless of who they scored it against , being the winner . in championship matches , this means that , unlike one - on - one matches ( where the champion can simply di ##s ##qual ##ify themselves or get themselves counted out to retain the title via the " champion ' s ad ##vant ##ag " ) , the champion does not have to be pinned or involved in the decision to lose the championship . however , heel champions often find advantages , not in champion ' s advantage , but in the use of weapons and outside interference , as these poly - sided matches tend to involve no holds barred rules .
this is done to give wrestlers a break from the action [SEP] sometimes , poly - sided matches that pit every one for themselves will incorporate tag ##ging rules . outside of kay ##fa ##be , this is done to give wrestlers a break from the action ( as these matches tend to go on for long periods of time ) , and to make the action in the ring easier to cho ##re ##og ##raph . one of the most mainstream examples of this is the four - corner match , the most common type of match in the wwe before it was replaced with its equivalent fatal four - way ; four wrestlers , each for themselves , fight in a match , but only two wrestlers can be in the match at any given time . the other two are positioned in the corner , and tags can be made between any two wrestlers .
four wrestlers , each for themselves , fight in a match , but only two wrestlers can be in the match at any given time . [SEP] sometimes , poly - sided matches that pit every one for themselves will incorporate tag ##ging rules . outside of kay ##fa ##be , this is done to give wrestlers a break from the action ( as these matches tend to go on for long periods of time ) , and to make the action in the ring easier to cho ##re ##og ##raph . one of the most mainstream examples of this is the four - corner match , the most common type of match in the wwe before it was replaced with its equivalent fatal four - way ; four wrestlers , each for themselves , fight in a match , but only two wrestlers can be in the match at any given time . the other two are positioned in the corner , and tags can be made between any two wrestlers .
one wrestler is covering another prone , back - first wrestler can be considered a pin attempt [SEP] however , although almost any scenario where one wrestler is covering another prone , back - first wrestler can be considered a pin attempt , there is one important exception to that rule : pin attempts broken up by other wrestlers . in matches involving multiple wrestlers ( such as triple threat matches or tag team matches ) , wrestlers who see a pin attempt that , if successful , would result in them losing the match are expected to run in and break the pin attempt by performing some sort of offensive maneuver on the wrestler attempting the pin . the most common attacks for breaking pins are a st ##omp to the back and an elbow to the back of the head , as they are simple to pull off in the spur of the moment . however , these moves , simple as they are , still leave the pinning wrestler on top of the pinned wrestler . despite the pinning wrestler still technically being on top of the pinned wrestler , the referee will still consider the pin attempt to be broken .
results in null ##ification of the pin attempt , [SEP] illegal pinning methods include using the ropes for leverage and hook ##ing the opponent ' s clothing , which are therefore popular cheating methods for heels , unless certain st ##ip ##ulation ##s make such an advantage legal . such pins as these are rarely seen by the referee ( as they have to see if their shoulders are down ) and are subsequently often used by heels and on occasion by cheating faces to win matches . even if it is noticed , it is rare for such an attempt to result in a disqualification ( see below ) , and instead it simply results in null ##ification of the pin attempt , so the heel wrestler rarely has anything to lose for trying it , anyway .
they are disqualified [SEP] since all contact between the wrestlers must cease if any part of the body is touching , or underneath , the ropes , many wrestlers will attempt to break submission holds by deliberately grabbing the bottom ropes . this is called a " rope break " , and it is one of the most common ways to break a submission hold . most holds leave an arm or leg free , so that the person can tap out if they want . instead , they use these free limbs to either grab one of the ring ropes ( the bottom one is the most common , as it is nearest the wrestlers , though other ropes sometimes are used for standing holds such as chris masters ' master lock ) or dr ##ape their foot across , or underneath one . once this has been accomplished , and the accomplishment is witnessed by the referee , the referee will demand that the off ##ending wrestler break the hold , and start counting to five if the wrestler does not . if the referee reaches the count of five , and the wrestler still does not break the hold , they are disqualified .
if nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count , the match is ruled a draw . [SEP] a wrestler can win by knockout ( sometimes referred to as a referee stop ##page ) if they do not resort to submission holds , but stills pu ##mmel ##s their opponent to the point that they are unconscious or are unable to intelligent ##ly defend themselves . to check for a knockout in this manner , a referee will wave their hand in front of the wrestler ' s face ; if the wrestler does not react in any way , the referee will award the victory to the other wrestler . if all the active wrestlers in a match are down inside the ring at the same time , the referee will begin a count ( usually ten seconds , twenty in japan ) . if nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count , the match is ruled a draw . any participant who stands up in time will end the count for everyone else . in a last man standing match , this form of a knockout is the only way that the match can end , so the referee will count when one or more wrestlers are down , and one wrestler standing up before the 10 - count doesn ' t stop the count for another wrestler who is still down .
when a wrestler is out of the ring long enough for the referee to count to ten [SEP] a count ##out ( alternatively " count - out " or " count out " ) happens when a wrestler is out of the ring long enough for the referee to count to ten ( twenty in some promotions ) and thus disqualified . the count is broken and restarted when a wrestler in the ring exits the ring . playing into this , some wrestlers will " milk " the count by sliding in the ring , and immediately sliding back out . as they were technically inside the ring for a split second before exiting again , it is sufficient to restart the count . this is often referred to by commentators as " breaking the count . " heels often use this tactic in order to buy themselves more time to catch their breath , or to attempt to fr ##ust ##rate their baby ##face opponents .
booker ##s in a company will place the title on the most accomplished performer , [SEP] behind the scenes , the booker ##s in a company will place the title on the most accomplished performer , or those the booker ##s believe will generate fan interest in terms of event attendance and television viewers ##hip . lower ranked titles may also be used on the performers who show potential , thus allowing them greater exposure to the audience . however other circumstances may also determine the use of a championship . a combination of a championship ' s lineage , the caliber of performers as champion , and the frequency and manner of title changes , di ##cta ##tes the audience ' s perception of the title ' s quality , significance and reputation .
have music and lyrics specially written for their ring entrance [SEP] all notable wrestlers now enter the ring accompanied by music , and regularly add other elements to their entrance . the music played during the ring entrance will usually mirror the wrestler ' s personality . many wrestlers , particularly in america , have music and lyrics specially written for their ring entrance . while invented long before , the practice of including music with the entrance gained rapid popularity during the 1980s , largely as a result of the huge success of hulk hogan and the wwf , and their rock ' n ' wrestling connection . when a match is won , the victor ' s theme music is usually also played in celebration .
the other team had to automatically switch their legal wrestler as well [SEP] in the 1980s , mixed tag team matches began to take place , with a male and female on each team and a rule stating that each wrestler could only attack the opponent of the same gender . if a tag was made , the other team had to automatically switch their legal wrestler as well . despite these restrictions , many mixed tag matches do feature some physical interaction between participants of different gender ##s . for example , a heel may take a cheap shot at the female wrestler of the opposing team to draw a negative crowd reaction . in lucha libre , cheap - shots and male - female attacks are not uncommon .
given a run with the cruiser ##weight championship [SEP] some wrestlers may have their own specific " mini me " , like mas ##car ##ita sa ##grad ##a , ale ##bri ##je has qui ##je , etc . there are also cases in which mid ##get ##s can become valet ##s for a wrestler , and even get physically involved in matches , like al ##ush ##e , who often acc ##omp ##anies tin ##ie ##bla ##s , or ke ##mon ##ito , who is portrayed as con ##se ##jo mu ##ndi ##al de lucha libre ' s mascot and is also a valet for mist ##ico . dave fin ##lay was often aided in his matches by a mid ##get known mainly as horns ##wo ##ggle while in wwe , who hid under the ring and gave a shi ##lle ##lag ##h to fin ##lay to use on his opponent . fin ##lay also occasionally threw him at his opponent ( s ) . horns ##wo ##ggle has also been given a run with the cruiser ##weight championship and feud ##ed with d - generation x in 2009 .
to accommodate then - recent changes in the american asa ph ##2 . 5 - 1960 standard [SEP] as in the sc ##hein ##er system , speeds were expressed in ' degrees ' . originally the sensitivity was written as a fraction with ' tenth ##s ' ( for example " 18 / 10 ##° din " ) , where the resultant value 1 . 8 represented the relative base 10 log ##ari ##th ##m of the speed . ' tenth ##s ' were later abandoned with din 451 ##2 : 1957 - 11 , and the example above would be written as " 18 ##° din " . the degree symbol was finally dropped with din 451 ##2 : 1961 - 10 . this revision also saw significant changes in the definition of film speeds in order to accommodate then - recent changes in the american asa ph ##2 . 5 - 1960 standard , so that film speeds of black - and - white negative film effectively would become doubled , that is , a film previously marked as " 18 ##° din " would now be labeled as " 21 din " without em ##ulsion changes .

rec ##ip ##rocity failure [SEP] upon exposure , the amount of light energy that reaches the film determines the effect upon the em ##ulsion . if the brightness of the light is multiplied by a factor and the exposure of the film decreased by the same factor by varying the camera ' s shutter speed and aperture , so that the energy received is the same , the film will be developed to the same density . this rule is called rec ##ip ##rocity . the systems for determining the sensitivity for an em ##ulsion are possible because rec ##ip ##rocity holds . in practice , rec ##ip ##rocity works reasonably well for normal photographic films for the range of exposure ##s between 1 / 1000 second to 1 / 2 second . however , this relationship breaks down outside these limits , a phenomenon known as rec ##ip ##rocity failure .
paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption [SEP] on thursday , september 19 , 1985 , at 7 : 19 am local time , mexico city was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 8 . 1 on the richter scale . although this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in asia and other parts of latin america , it proved to be a disaster politically for the one - party government . the government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption , forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to rec ##ons ##truct much of the housing that was lost as well .
no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountains ##ides [SEP] mexico city is located in the valley of mexico , sometimes called the basin of mexico . this valley is located in the trans - mexican volcanic belt in the high plateau ##s of south - central mexico . it has a minimum altitude of 2 , 200 meters ( 7 , 200 feet ) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5 , 000 metres ( 16 , 000 feet ) . this valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountains ##ides , making the city vulnerable to flooding . drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century .
destroyed during the siege of ten ##och ##ti ##tlan [SEP] originally much of the valley laid beneath the waters of lake tex ##co ##co , a system of inter ##connected salt and freshwater lakes . the aztec ##s built di ##kes to separate the fresh water used to raise crops in china ##mp ##as and to prevent rec ##urrent floods . these di ##kes were destroyed during the siege of ten ##och ##ti ##tlan , and during colonial times the spanish regularly drained the lake to prevent floods . only a small section of the original lake remains , located outside the federal district , in the municipality of ate ##nco , state of mexico .
to run in the 2000 presidential elections [SEP] the first elected head of government was cu ##au ##ht ##em ##oc card ##enas . card ##enas resigned in 1999 to run in the 2000 presidential elections and designated rosario rob ##les to succeed him , who became the first woman ( elected or otherwise ) to govern mexico city . in 2000 andres manuel lopez ob ##rad ##or was elected , and resigned in 2005 to run in the 2006 presidential elections , alejandro en ##cina ##s being designated by the legislative assembly to finish the term . in 2006 , marcelo e ##bra ##rd was elected for the 2006 – 2012 period .
over - representation [SEP] even though proportional ##ity is confined to the proportional seats to prevent a part from being over ##re ##pres ##ented , several restrictions apply in the assign ##ation of the seats ; namely , that no party can have more than 63 % of all seats , both un ##ino ##mina ##l and pl ##uri ##no ##mina ##l . in the 2006 elections leftist pr ##d got the absolute majority in the direct un ##ino ##mina ##l elections , securing 34 of the 40 f ##pp seats . as such , the pr ##d was not assigned any pl ##uri ##no ##mina ##l seat to comply with the law that prevents over - representation . the overall composition of the legislative assembly is :
interrupted by the mexican revolution [SEP] cha ##pu ##lt ##ep ##ec park houses the cha ##pu ##lt ##ep ##ec castle , now a museum on a hill that overlook ##s the park and its numerous museums , monuments and the national zoo and the national museum of anthropology ( which houses the aztec calendar stone ) . another piece of architecture is the fine arts palace , a white marble theatre / museum whose weight is such that it has gradually been sinking into the soft ground below . its construction began during the presidency of por ##fi ##rio diaz and ended in 1934 , after being interrupted by the mexican revolution in the 1920s . the plaza of the three cultures in the t ##late ##lo ##lco neighbourhood , and the shrine and basilica ##s of our lady of guadalupe are also important sites . there is a double - decker bus , known as the " tu ##ri ##bus " , that circles most of these sites , and has timed audio describing the sites in multiple languages as they are passed .
his accent [SEP] napoleon ' s noble , moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical corsica ##n of the time . in january 1779 , he was enrolled at a religious school in au ##tu ##n . in may , he was admitted to a military academy at brien ##ne - le - chateau . his first language was corsica ##n , and he always spoke french with a marked corsica ##n accent and never learned to spell french properly . he was teased by other students for his accent and applied himself to reading . an examiner observed that napoleon " has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics . he is fairly well acquainted with history and geography . . . this boy would make an excellent sailor .

either escaped into asia , or otherwise blended in amongst europeans [SEP] the germanic peoples during the migration ##s period came into contact with other peoples ; in the case of the populations settling in the territory of modern germany , they encountered ce ##lts to the south , and bal ##ts and sl ##avs towards the east . the lime ##s germanic ##us was breached in ad 260 . migrating germanic tribes com ##ming ##led with the local gallo - roman populations in what is now sw ##abia and bavaria . the arrival of the hu ##ns in europe resulted in hu ##n conquest of large parts of eastern europe , the hu ##ns initially were allies of the roman empire who fought against germanic tribes , but later the hu ##ns cooperate ##d with the germanic tribe of the os ##tro ##go ##ths , and large numbers of germans lived within the lands of the hu ##nni ##c empire of at ##tila . at ##tila had both hu ##nni ##c and germanic families and prominent germanic chiefs amongst his close entourage in europe . the hu ##ns living in germanic territories in eastern europe adopted an east germanic language as their ling ##ua fran ##ca . a major part of at ##tila ' s army were germans , during the hu ##ns ' campaign against the roman empire . after at ##tila ' s unexpected death the hu ##nni ##c empire collapsed with the hu ##ns disappearing as a people in europe – who either escaped into asia , or otherwise blended in amongst europeans .
were ass ##imi ##lated into german culture [SEP] after christian ##ization , the roman catholic church and local rulers led german expansion and settlement in areas inhabited by sl ##avs and bal ##ts , known as os ##ts ##ied ##lun ##g . during the wars wage ##d in the baltic by the catholic german te ##uto ##nic knights ; the lands inhabited by the ethnic group of the old prussian ##s ( the current reference to the people known then simply as the " prussian ##s " ) , were conquered by the germans . the old prussian ##s were an ethnic group related to the latvian and lithuanian baltic peoples . the former german state of prussia took its name from the baltic prussian ##s , although it was led by germans who had ass ##imi ##lated the old prussian ##s ; the old prussian language was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century . the slavic people of the te ##uto ##nic - controlled baltic were ass ##imi ##lated into german culture and eventually there were many inter ##mar ##ria ##ges of slavic and german families , including amongst the prussia ' s aristocracy known as the junk ##ers . prussian military st ##rate ##gist karl von clause ##witz is a famous german whose surname is of slavic origin . massive german settlement led to the assimilation of baltic ( old prussian ##s ) and slavic ( wen ##ds ) populations , who were exhausted by previous warfare .
forcefully expelled from germany [SEP] by the middle ages , large numbers of jews lived in the holy roman empire and had ass ##imi ##lated into german culture , including many jews who had previously ass ##imi ##lated into french culture and had spoken a mixed jude ##o - french language . upon ass ##imi ##lating into german culture , the jewish german peoples incorporated major parts of the german language and elements of other european languages into a mixed language known as yiddish . however tolerance and assimilation of jews in german society suddenly ended during the crusade ##s with many jews being forcefully expelled from germany and western yiddish disappeared as a language in germany over the centuries , with german jewish people fully adopting the german language .
the tropical rain belt [SEP] the climate in southeast asia is mainly tropical – hot and humid all year round with pl ##ent ##iful rainfall . northern vietnam and the myanmar himalayas are the only regions in southeast asia that feature a subtropical climate , which has a cold winter with snow . the majority of southeast asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or monsoon . the tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season . the rain forest is the second largest on earth ( with the amazon being the largest ) . an exception to this type of climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region , where high altitudes lead to mild ##er temperatures and dr ##ier landscape . other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert like .

there is no spring break [SEP] the university operates under 11 colleges or schools , which collectively offer 194 bachelor ' s degree programs , 68 master ' s degree programs , 25 phd programs , and a juris doctor program . byu also manages some courses and majors through the david m . kennedy center for international studies and " miscellaneous " college departments , including undergraduate education , graduate studies , independent study , continuing education , and the honors program . byu ' s winter semester ends earlier than most universities in april since there is no spring break , thus allowing students to pursue internship ##s and other summer activities earlier . a typical academic year is broken up into two semester ##s : fall ( september – december ) and winter ( january – april ) , as well as two shorter terms during the summer months : spring ( may – june ) and summer ( july – august ) .
many of its players serve on full - time missions for two years [SEP] byu has 21 ncaa varsity teams . nineteen of these teams played mainly in the mountain west conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011 . prior to that time byu teams competed in the western athletic conference . all teams are named the " cougars " , and co ##smo the co ##uga ##r has been the school ' s mascot since 1953 . the school ' s fight song is the co ##uga ##r fight song . because many of its players serve on full - time missions for two years ( men when they ' re 18 , women when 19 ) , byu athletes are often older on average than other schools ' players . the ncaa allows students to serve missions for two years without sub ##tra ##cting that time from their eligibility period . this has caused minor controversy , but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage , since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions . byu has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on sunday , as well as ex ##pel ##ling players due to honor code violations . beginning in the 2011 season , byu football competes in college football as an independent . in addition , most other sports now compete in the west coast conference . teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men ' s volleyball program in the mountain pacific sports federation . for outdoor track and field , the cougars became an independent . softball returned to the western athletic conference , but spent only one season in the wa ##c ; the team moved to the pacific coast softball conference after the 2012 season . the softball program may move again after the 2013 season ; the july 2013 return of pacific to the wc ##c will enable that conference to add softball as an official sport .
or ##ida had become " a derelict open to the o ##cc ##up ##ancy of every enemy , civilized or savage [SEP] seminole indians based in east florida began raiding georgia settlements , and offering haven ##s for runaway slaves . the united states army led increasingly frequent inc ##urs ##ions into spanish territory , including the 1817 – 1818 campaign against the seminole indians by andrew jackson that became known as the first seminole war . the united states now effectively controlled east florida . control was necessary according to secretary of state john quincy adams because florida had become " a derelict open to the o ##cc ##up ##ancy of every enemy , civilized or savage , of the united states , and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them . " .
florida had become a burden to spain , which could not afford to send settlers or garrison ##s [SEP] florida had become a burden to spain , which could not afford to send settlers or garrison ##s . madrid therefore decided to ce ##de the territory to the united states through the adams - on ##is treaty , which took effect in 1821 . president james monroe was authorized on march 3 , 1821 to take possession of east florida and west florida for the united states and provide for initial governance . andrew jackson served as military governor of the newly acquired territory , but only for a brief period . on march 30 , 1822 , the united states merged east florida and part of west florida into the florida territory .
that at least two districts had to be red ##ra ##wn because of gerry ##man ##der ##ing [SEP] the court ruled in 2014 , after lengthy testimony , that at least two districts had to be red ##ra ##wn because of gerry ##man ##der ##ing . after this was appealed , in july 2015 the florida supreme court ruled that law ##makers had followed an illegal and unconstitutional process overly influenced by party operatives , and ruled that at least eight districts had to be red ##ra ##wn . on december 2 , 2015 , a 5 - 2 majority of the court accepted a new map of congressional districts , some of which was drawn by challenger ##s . their ruling affirmed the map previously approved by leon county judge terry lewis , who had overseen the original trial . it particularly makes changes in south florida . there are likely to be additional challenges to the map and districts .
were driven away [SEP] th ##uring ##ia generally accepted the protestant reformation , and roman catholicism was suppressed as early as 152 ##0 [ citation needed ] ; priests who remained loyal to it were driven away and churches and monasteries were largely destroyed , especially during the german peasants ' war of 152 ##5 . in mu ##hl ##hausen and elsewhere , the ana ##ba ##pt ##ists found many adherents . thomas mu ##nt ##zer , a leader of some non - peaceful groups of this sect , was active in this city . within the borders of modern th ##uring ##ia the roman catholic faith only survived in the e ##ich ##sf ##eld district , which was ruled by the archbishop of mainz , and to a small degree in er ##furt and its immediate vicinity .
due to many centuries of intensive settlement [SEP] due to many centuries of intensive settlement , most of the area is shaped by human influence . the original natural vegetation of th ##uring ##ia is forest with beech as its predominant species , as can still be found in the hai ##nic ##h mountains today . in the upland ##s , a mixture of beech and spruce would be natural . however , most of the plains have been cleared and are in intensive agricultural use while most of the forests are planted with spruce and pine . since 1990 , th ##uring ##ia ' s forests have been managed aiming for a more natural and tough vegetation more res ##ili ##ent to climate change as well as diseases and ve ##rmin . in comparison to the forest , agriculture is still quite conventional and dominated by large structures and mono ##culture ##s . problems here are caused especially by increasingly prolonged dry periods during the summer months .
emigration of young women [SEP] the th ##uring ##ian population has a significant sex ratio gap , caused by the emigration of young women , especially in rural areas . overall , there are 115 to 120 men per 100 women in the 25 – 40 age group ( " family founders " ) which has negative consequences for the birth ratio . furthermore , the population is getting older and older with some rural municipalities recording more than 30 % of over - 65 ##s ( pension ##ers ) . this is a problem for the regional labour market , as there are twice as many people leaving as entering the job market annually .
because the competition from imported metal was too strong [SEP] mining was important in th ##uring ##ia since the later middle ages , especially within the mining towns of the th ##uring ##ian forest such as sc ##hma ##lka ##lden , su ##hl and il ##men ##au . following the industrial revolution , the old iron , copper and silver mines declined because the competition from imported metal was too strong . on the other hand , the late 19th century brought new types of mines to th ##uring ##ia : the li ##gni ##te surface mining around me ##use ##l ##witz near alt ##enburg in the east of the land started in the 1870s , and two pot ##ash mining districts were established around 1900 . these are the sud ##har ##z ##re ##vier in the north of the state , between bis ##cho ##ffer ##ode in the west and ro ##ß ##le ##ben in the east with son ##ders ##hausen at its centre , and the we ##rra ##re ##vier on the hess ##ian border around va ##cha and bad sal ##zu ##ngen in the west . together , they accounted for a significant part of the world ' s pot ##ash production in the mid - 20th century . after the reunification , the sud ##har ##z ##re ##vier was abandoned , whereas k + s took over the mines in the we ##rra ##re ##vier . between 1950 and 1990 , uranium mining was also important to cover the soviet union ' s need for this metal . the centre was ron ##ne ##burg near ge ##ra in eastern th ##uring ##ia and the operating company wi ##sm ##ut was under direct soviet control .
rational ##isation processes in the german health care system [SEP] health care in th ##uring ##ia is currently undergoing a concentration process . many smaller hospitals in the rural towns are closing , whereas the bigger ones in centres like jena and er ##furt get enlarged . overall , there is an overs ##up ##ply of hospital beds , caused by rational ##isation processes in the german health care system , so that many smaller hospitals generate losses . on the other hand , there is a lack of family doctors , especially in rural regions with increased need of health care provision because of over ##age ##ing .
eat from multiple levels of the food chain [SEP] many organisms ( of which humans are prime examples ) eat from multiple levels of the food chain and , thus , make this classification problematic . a car ##ni ##vor ##e may eat both secondary and tertiary consumers , and its prey may itself be difficult to classify for similar reasons . organisms showing both car ##ni ##vor ##y and herb ##ivo ##ry are known as om ##ni ##vor ##es . even herb ##ivo ##res such as the giant panda may supplement their diet with meat . sc ##ave ##nging of carr ##ion provides a significant part of the diet of some of the most fears ##ome predators . car ##nivorous plants would be very difficult to fit into this classification , producing their own food but also digest ##ing anything that they may trap . organisms that eat det ##rit ##ivo ##res or parasites would also be difficult to classify by such a scheme .
producing their own food but also digest ##ing anything that they may trap [SEP] many organisms ( of which humans are prime examples ) eat from multiple levels of the food chain and , thus , make this classification problematic . a car ##ni ##vor ##e may eat both secondary and tertiary consumers , and its prey may itself be difficult to classify for similar reasons . organisms showing both car ##ni ##vor ##y and herb ##ivo ##ry are known as om ##ni ##vor ##es . even herb ##ivo ##res such as the giant panda may supplement their diet with meat . sc ##ave ##nging of carr ##ion provides a significant part of the diet of some of the most fears ##ome predators . car ##nivorous plants would be very difficult to fit into this classification , producing their own food but also digest ##ing anything that they may trap . organisms that eat det ##rit ##ivo ##res or parasites would also be difficult to classify by such a scheme .
without pre ##dation , herb ##ivo ##res began to over - graz ##e many woody brows ##e species [SEP] the elimination of wolves from yellowstone national park had profound impacts on the tr ##op ##hic pyramid . without pre ##dation , herb ##ivo ##res began to over - graz ##e many woody brows ##e species , affecting the area ' s plant populations . in addition , wolves often kept animals from grazing in rip ##arian areas , which protected beaver ##s from having their food sources en ##cr ##oa ##ched upon . the removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations , as their habitat became territory for grazing . furthermore , pre ##dation keeps hydro ##logical features such as creeks and streams in normal working order . increased brows ##ing on willow ##s and con ##ifer ##s along black ##tail creek due to a lack of pre ##dation caused channel inc ##ision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place .
warmth , companions ##hip , and even protection [SEP] it has been observed that well - fed predator animals in a lax captivity ( for instance , pet or farm animals ) will usually differentiate between put ##ative prey animals who are familiar co - inhabitants in the same human area from wild ones outside the area . this interaction can range from peaceful coe ##xi ##sten ##ce to close companions ##hip ; motivation to ignore the predatory instinct may result from mutual advantage or fear of rep ##ris ##al from human masters who have made clear that harm ##ing co - inhabitants will not be tolerated . pet cats and pet mice , for example , may live together in the same human residence without incident as companions . pet cats and pet dogs under human masters ##hip often depend on each other for warmth , companions ##hip , and even protection , particularly in rural areas .
facilitated the academic study of plants [SEP] botany originated in pre ##his ##tory as herbal ##ism with the efforts of early humans to identify – and later cult ##ivate – edible , medicinal and poisonous plants , making it one of the oldest branches of science . medieval ph ##ys ##ic gardens , often attached to monasteries , contained plants of medical importance . they were forerunner ##s of the first botanical gardens attached to universities , founded from the 1540 ##s onwards . one of the earliest was the padua botanical garden . these gardens facilitated the academic study of plants . efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy , and led in 1753 to the bin ##omi ##al system of carl linnaeus that remains in use to this day .
to catalogue and describe their collections [SEP] botany originated in pre ##his ##tory as herbal ##ism with the efforts of early humans to identify – and later cult ##ivate – edible , medicinal and poisonous plants , making it one of the oldest branches of science . medieval ph ##ys ##ic gardens , often attached to monasteries , contained plants of medical importance . they were forerunner ##s of the first botanical gardens attached to universities , founded from the 1540 ##s onwards . one of the earliest was the padua botanical garden . these gardens facilitated the academic study of plants . efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy , and led in 1753 to the bin ##omi ##al system of carl linnaeus that remains in use to this day .
for medical use [SEP] in the mid - 16th century , " botanical gardens " were founded in a number of italian universities – the padua botanical garden in 154 ##5 is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location . these gardens continued the practical value of earlier " ph ##ys ##ic gardens " , often associated with monasteries , in which plants were cultivated for medical use . they supported the growth of botany as an academic subject . lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens and their medical uses demonstrated . botanical gardens came much later to northern europe ; the first in england was the university of oxford botanic garden in 1621 . throughout this period , botany remained firmly subordinate to medicine .
newly discovered countries [SEP] during the 18th century , systems of plant identification were developed comparable to di ##cho ##tom ##ous keys , where unidentified plants are placed into taxonomic groups ( e . g . family , genus and species ) by making a series of choices between pairs of characters . the choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification ( diagnostic keys ) or more closely related to the natural or ph ##yle ##tic order of the taxa in syn ##op ##tic keys . by the 18th century , new plants for study were arriving in europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the european colonies worldwide . in 1753 carl von lin ##ne ( carl linnaeus ) published his species plant ##aru ##m , a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature . this established a standard ##ised bin ##omi ##al or two - part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus . for the purposes of identification , linnaeus ' s system ##a sexual ##e classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs . the 24th group , crypt ##oga ##mia , included all plants with concealed reproductive parts , moss ##es , liver ##wo ##rts , ferns , algae and fungi .
oxygen and food [SEP] the study of plants is vital because they under ##pin almost all animal life on earth by generating a large proportion of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with aero ##bic res ##piration with the chemical energy they need to exist . plants , algae and cy ##ano ##ba ##cter ##ia are the major groups of organisms that carry out photos ##yn ##thesis , a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugar ##s that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells . as a by - product of photos ##yn ##thesis , plants release oxygen into the atmosphere , a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular res ##piration . in addition , they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stab ##ilis ##e soils , preventing soil erosion . plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food , oxygen , medicine , and products for people , as well as creating and preserving soil .
energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil [SEP] virtually all staple foods come either directly from primary production by plants , or indirectly from animals that eat them . plants and other photos ##yn ##the ##tic organisms are at the base of most food chains because they use the energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil and atmosphere , converting them into a form that can be used by animals . this is what eco ##logists call the first tr ##op ##hic level . the modern forms of the major staple foods , such as maize , rice , wheat and other cereal grasses , pulses , bananas and plant ##ains , as well as fl ##ax and cotton grown for their fibre ##s , are the outcome of prehistoric selection over thousands of years from among wild ancestral plants with the most desirable characteristics . botanist ##s study how plants produce food and how to increase yields , for example through plant breeding , making their work important to mankind ' s ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations . botanist ##s also study weeds , which are a considerable problem in agriculture , and the biology and control of plant pathogen ##s in agriculture and natural ecosystems . et ##hn ##ob ##ota ##ny is the study of the relationships between plants and people . when applied to the investigation of historical plant – people relationships et ##hn ##ob ##ota ##ny may be referred to as arch ##ae ##ob ##ota ##ny or pal ##ae ##oe ##th ##nob ##ota ##ny .

for export to the rest of the plant [SEP] the light energy captured by ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l a is initially in the form of electrons ( and later a proton gradient ) that ' s used to make molecules of atp and nad ##ph which temporarily store and transport energy . their energy is used in the light - independent reactions of the calvin cycle by the enzyme rub ##is ##co to produce molecules of the 3 - carbon sugar g ##ly ##cera ##lde ##hy ##de 3 - phosphate ( g ##3 ##p ) . g ##ly ##cera ##lde ##hy ##de 3 - phosphate is the first product of photos ##yn ##thesis and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesized . some of the glucose is converted to star ##ch which is stored in the ch ##lor ##op ##las ##t . star ##ch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae , while in ##ulin , a polymer of fr ##uc ##tose is used for the same purpose in the sun ##flower family as ##tera ##ceae . some of the glucose is converted to su ##cr ##ose ( common table sugar ) for export to the rest of the plant .
ozone de ##ple ##tion [SEP] plant responses to climate and other environmental changes can inform our understanding of how these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity . for example , plant ph ##eno ##logy can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical cl ##ima ##tology , and the biological impact of climate change and global warming . pal ##yn ##ology , the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from thousands or millions of years ago allows the reconstruction of past climates . estimates of atmospheric co ##2 concentrations since the pal ##ae ##oz ##oic have been obtained from st ##oma ##tal den ##sities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants . ozone de ##ple ##tion can expose plants to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation - b ( uv - b ) , resulting in lower growth rates . moreover , information from studies of community ecology , plant systematic ##s , and taxonomy is essential to understanding vegetation change , habitat destruction and species extinction .
opportunities for fe ##rti ##lis ##ation of flowers by animals are rare [SEP] unlike in higher animals , where part ##hen ##ogen ##esis is rare , as ##ex ##ual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms . the formation of stem tube ##rs in potato is one example . particularly in arctic or alpine habitats , where opportunities for fe ##rti ##lis ##ation of flowers by animals are rare , plant ##lets or bulbs , may develop instead of flowers , replacing sexual reproduction with as ##ex ##ual reproduction and giving rise to cl ##onal populations genetically identical to the parent . this is one of several types of ap ##omi ##xi ##s that occur in plants . ap ##omi ##xi ##s can also happen in a seed , producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent .
errors in cy ##tok ##ines ##is [SEP] most sexually rep ##rod ##uc ##ing organisms are dip ##loid , with paired chromosomes , but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cy ##tok ##ines ##is . this can occur early in development to produce an auto ##pol ##yp ##loid or partly auto ##pol ##yp ##loid organism , or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are poly ##pl ##oid ( end ##op ##ol ##yp ##loid ##y ) , or during game ##te formation . an all ##op ##ol ##yp ##loid plant may result from a hybrid ##isation event between two different species . both auto ##pol ##yp ##loid and all ##op ##ol ##yp ##loid plants can often reproduce normally , but may be unable to cross - breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mis ##mat ##ch in chromosome numbers . these plants that are reproductive ##ly isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area , may be sufficiently successful to form a new species . some otherwise sterile plant poly ##pl ##oids can still reproduce ve ##get ##ative ##ly or by seed ap ##omi ##xi ##s , forming cl ##onal populations of identical individuals . du ##rum wheat is a fertile te ##tra ##pl ##oid all ##op ##ol ##yp ##loid , while bread wheat is a fertile he ##xa ##pl ##oid . the commercial banana is an example of a sterile , seed ##less trip ##loid hybrid . common dan ##del ##ion is a trip ##loid that produces viable seeds by ap ##omic ##tic seed .

one of the smallest genome ##s [SEP] a considerable amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the tha ##le cr ##ess , arab ##ido ##psis tha ##lian ##a , a weed ##y species in the mustard family ( brass ##ica ##ceae ) . the genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of dna , forming one of the smallest genome ##s among flowering plants . arab ##ido ##psis was the first plant to have its genome sequence ##d , in 2000 . the sequencing of some other relatively small genome ##s , of rice ( or ##y ##za sat ##iva ) and bra ##chy ##pod ##ium di ##sta ##chy ##on , has made them important model species for understanding the genetics , cellular and molecular biology of cereal ##s , grasses and mono ##cot ##s generally .

small genome ##s [SEP] model plants such as arab ##ido ##psis tha ##lian ##a are used for studying the molecular biology of plant cells and the ch ##lor ##op ##las ##t . ideally , these organisms have small genome ##s that are well known or completely sequence ##d , small stature and short generation times . corn has been used to study mechanisms of photos ##yn ##thesis and ph ##loe ##m loading of sugar in c ##4 plants . the single cell ##ed green al ##ga ch ##lam ##yd ##omo ##nas rein ##hardt ##ii , while not an embryo ##phy ##te itself , contains a green - pigment ##ed ch ##lor ##op ##las ##t related to that of land plants , making it useful for study . a red al ##ga cy ##ani ##dio ##sch ##y ##zon mer ##ola ##e has also been used to study some basic ch ##lor ##op ##las ##t functions . spin ##ach , peas , soy ##be ##ans and a moss ph ##ys ##com ##it ##rella pat ##ens are commonly used to study plant cell biology .
ability to give rise to a new individual plant [SEP] unlike animals , many plant cells , particularly those of the par ##en ##chy ##ma , do not terminal ##ly differentiate , remaining to ##tip ##ote ##nt with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant . exceptions include highly li ##gni ##fied cells , the sc ##ler ##en ##chy ##ma and x ##yle ##m which are dead at maturity , and the ph ##loe ##m si ##eve tubes which lack nuclei . while plants use many of the same ep ##igen ##etic mechanisms as animals , such as ch ##rom ##atin re ##mo ##del ##ing , an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using position ##al information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate .

movements of plant shoots [SEP] the hypothesis that plant growth and development is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century . darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity , and concluded " it is hardly an ex ##agger ##ation to say that the tip of the ra ##dic ##le . . acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . . directing the several movements " . about the same time , the role of aux ##ins ( from the greek aux ##ein , to grow ) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the dutch scientist fr ##its went . the first known aux ##in , indo ##le - 3 - ace ##tic acid ( ia ##a ) , which promotes cell growth , was only isolated from plants about 50 years later . this compound media ##tes the tr ##op ##ic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity . the finding in 1939 that plant call ##us could be maintained in culture containing ia ##a , followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification .
can often reg ##row it [SEP] the root system and the shoot system are inter ##de ##pen ##dent – the usually non ##ph ##oto ##sy ##nt ##hetic root system depends on the shoot system for food , and the usually photos ##yn ##the ##tic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system . cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing advent ##iti ##ous shoots or roots . st ##olo ##ns and tube ##rs are examples of shoots that can grow roots . roots that spread out close to the surface , such as those of willow ##s , can produce shoots and ultimately new plants . in the event that one of the systems is lost , the other can often reg ##row it . in fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf , as is the case with saint ##pa ##ulia , or even a single cell – which can de ##di ##ffer ##ent ##iate into a call ##us ( a mass of un ##sp ##ec ##ial ##ised cells ) that can grow into a new plant . in vascular plants , the x ##yle ##m and ph ##loe ##m are the conduct ##ive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots . roots are often adapted to store food such as sugar ##s or star ##ch , as in sugar bee ##ts and carrot ##s .
too sexually explicit [SEP] the immaculate collection , madonna ' s first greatest - hits compilation album , was released in november 1990 . it included two new songs , " justify my love " and " rescue me " . the album was certified diamond by riaa and sold over 30 million copies worldwide , becoming the best - selling compilation album by a solo artist in history . " justify my love " reached number one in the u . s . and top ten worldwide . its music video featured scenes of sad ##oma ##so ##chi ##sm , bond ##age , same - sex kissing , and brief nu ##dity . the video was deemed too sexually explicit for mtv and was banned from the network . madonna responded to the banning : " why is it that people are willing to go and watch a movie about someone getting blown to bits for no reason at all , and nobody wants to see two girls kissing and two men s ##nu ##gg ##ling ? "
used religious symbols [SEP] madonna embarked on the confessions tour in may 2006 , which had a global audience of 1 . 2 million and grossed over $ 193 . 7 million , becoming the highest - grossing tour to that date for a female artist . madonna used religious symbols , such as the cr ##uc ##if ##ix and crown of thorns , in the performance of " live to tell " . it caused the russian orthodox church and the federation of jewish communities of russia to urge all their members to boycott her concert . at the same time , the international federation of the ph ##ono ##graphic industry ( if ##pi ) announced officially that madonna had sold over 200 million copies for her albums alone worldwide .
no sensible lower court will enforce [SEP] notably , a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional ; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute . many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional . however , under the principle of stare dec ##isi ##s , no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute , and any court that does so will be reversed by the supreme court . conversely , any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute ( where such constitutional ##ity has been express ##ly established in prior cases ) will risk reversal by the supreme court .

coe ##xi ##st with each other [SEP] during the 18th and 19th centuries , federal law traditionally focused on areas where there was an express grant of power to the federal government in the federal constitution , like the military , money , foreign relations ( especially international treaties ) , tariffs , intellectual property ( specifically patents and copyright ##s ) , and mail . since the start of the 20th century , broad interpretations of the commerce and spending clauses of the constitution have enabled federal law to expand into areas like aviation , telecommunications , railroads , pharmaceuticals , anti ##trust , and trademark ##s . in some areas , like aviation and railroads , the federal government has developed a comprehensive scheme that pre ##em ##pts virtually all state law , while in others , like family law , a relatively small number of federal statutes ( generally covering interstate and international situations ) interact ##s with a much larger body of state law . in areas like anti ##trust , trademark , and employment law , there are powerful laws at both the federal and state levels that coe ##xi ##st with each other . in a handful of areas like insurance , congress has enacted laws express ##ly refusing to regulate them as long as the states have laws regulating them ( see , e . g . , the mcc ##ar ##ran - ferguson act ) .
assigned a law number [SEP] after the president signs a bill into law ( or congress en ##act ##s it over his veto ) , it is delivered to the office of the federal register ( of ##r ) of the national archives and records administration ( nara ) where it is assigned a law number , and prepared for publication as a slip law . public laws , but not private laws , are also given legal statutory citation by the of ##r . at the end of each session of congress , the slip laws are compiled into bound volumes called the united states statutes at large , and they are known as session laws . the statutes at large present a chronological arrangement of the laws in the exact order that they have been enacted .
too grid ##lock ##ed to draft detailed statutes that explain how the agency should react to every possible situation [SEP] congress often en ##act ##s statutes that grant broad rule ##making authority to federal agencies . often , congress is simply too grid ##lock ##ed to draft detailed statutes that explain how the agency should react to every possible situation , or congress believes the agency ' s technical specialists are best equipped to deal with particular fact situations as they arise . therefore , federal agencies are authorized to prom ##ul ##gate regulations . under the principle of che ##vron def ##erence , regulations normally carry the force of law as long as they are based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes .
an appellate court ' s ruling ##s will thereby bind itself and lower courts in future cases [SEP] the difficult question is whether federal judicial power extends to formula ##ting binding precedent through strict adherence to the rule of stare dec ##isi ##s . this is where the act of deciding a case becomes a limited form of law ##making in itself , in that an appellate court ' s ruling ##s will thereby bind itself and lower courts in future cases ( and therefore also implied ##ly binds all persons within the court ' s jurisdiction ) . prior to a major change to federal court rules in 2007 , about one - fifth of federal appellate cases were published and thereby became binding precedent ##s , while the rest were unpublished and bound only the parties to each case .
reporters often simply re ##wr ##ote or failed to publish decisions which they disliked [SEP] as federal judge alex ko ##zin ##ski has pointed out , binding precedent as we know it today simply did not exist at the time the constitution was framed . judicial decisions were not consistently , accurately , and faithful ##ly reported on both sides of the atlantic ( reporters often simply re ##wr ##ote or failed to publish decisions which they disliked ) , and the united kingdom lacked a coherent court hierarchy prior to the end of the 19th century . furthermore , english judges in the eighteenth century sub ##scribe ##d to now - obsolete natural law theories of law , by which law was believed to have an existence independent of what individual judges said . judges saw themselves as merely declaring the law which had always theoretically existed , and not as making the law . therefore , a judge could reject another judge ' s opinion as simply an incorrect statement of the law , in the way that scientists regularly reject each other ' s conclusions as incorrect statements of the laws of science .

in the absence of case law , it would be completely un ##work ##able for every minor issue in every legal case to be brief ##ed , argued , and decided [SEP] in turn , according to ko ##zin ##ski ' s analysis , the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the u . s . in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy ( under the judiciary acts ) , and the beginning of regular verb ##ati ##m publication of u . s . appellate decisions by west publishing . the rule gradually developed , case - by - case , as an extension of the judiciary ' s public policy of effective judicial administration ( that is , in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power ) . the rule of precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy , first , as a matter of fundamental fairness , and second , because in the absence of case law , it would be completely un ##work ##able for every minor issue in every legal case to be brief ##ed , argued , and decided from first principles ( such as relevant statutes , constitutional provisions , and underlying public policies ) , which in turn would create hopeless in ##ef ##fi ##ciency , instability , and un ##pre ##dict ##ability , and thereby undermine the rule of law .
the pagan kingdom fell due to the mongol invasions and several warring states emerged [SEP] early civil ##isation ##s in myanmar included the tibet ##o - burma ##n - speaking p ##yu city - states in upper burma and the mon kingdoms in lower burma . in the 9th century , the bam ##ar people entered the upper ir ##ra ##wad ##dy valley and , following the establishment of the pagan kingdom in the 105 ##0s , the burmese language , culture and the ##ra ##va ##da buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . the pagan kingdom fell due to the mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . in the 16th century , re ##uni ##fied by the tau ##ngo ##o dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of southeast asia . the early 19th century ko ##nb ##au ##ng dynasty ruled over an area that included modern myanmar and briefly controlled mani ##pur and assam as well . the british conquered myanmar after three anglo - burmese wars in the 19th century and the country became a british colony . myanmar became an independent nation in 1948 , initially as a democratic nation and then , following a coup d ' etat in 1962 , a military dictatorship .

[SEP] burmese resentment was strong and was vent ##ed in violent riots that para ##ly ##sed yang ##on ( rang ##oon ) on occasion all the way until the 1930s . some of the discontent was caused by a di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct for burmese culture and traditions such as the british refusal to remove shoes when they entered pagoda ##s . buddhist monks became the vanguard ##s of the independence movement . u wi ##sar ##a , an activist monk , died in prison after a 166 - day hunger strike to protest against a rule that forbade him from wearing his buddhist robes while imprisoned .
declared martial law after widespread protests . [SEP] in 1988 , unrest over economic mis ##mana ##gement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro - democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the 88 ##8 ##8 uprising . security forces killed thousands of demonstrators , and general saw ma ##ung staged a coup d ' etat and formed the state law and order restoration council ( sl ##or ##c ) . in 1989 , sl ##or ##c declared martial law after widespread protests . the military government final ##ised plans for people ' s assembly elections on 31 may 1989 . sl ##or ##c changed the country ' s official english name from the " socialist republic of the union of burma " to the " union of myanmar " in 1989 .
the creation of a " discipline - flourishing democracy " [SEP] the goal of the burmese constitutional referendum of 2008 , held on 10 may 2008 , is the creation of a " discipline - flourishing democracy " . as part of the referendum process , the name of the country was changed from the " union of myanmar " to the " republic of the union of myanmar " , and general elections were held under the new constitution in 2010 . observer accounts of the 2010 election describe the event as mostly peaceful ; however , allegations of polling station irregularities were raised , and the united nations ( un ) and a number of western countries condemned the elections as fraudulent .
granting of general am ##nes ##ties for more than 200 political prisoners [SEP] since the 2010 election , the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards liberal democracy , a mixed economy , and reconciliation , although doubts persist about the motives that under ##pin such reforms . the series of reforms includes the release of pro - democracy leader au ##ng san su ##u ky ##i from house arrest , the establishment of the national human rights commission , the granting of general am ##nes ##ties for more than 200 political prisoners , new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes , a relaxation of press censorship , and the regulation of currency practices .
over the issue of human rights abuses by the ruling junta [SEP] in 2008 , india suspended military aid to myanmar over the issue of human rights abuses by the ruling junta , although it has preserved extensive commercial ties , which provide the regime with much - needed revenue . the tha ##w in relations began on 28 november 2011 , when belarusian prime minister mikhail my ##as ##nikov ##ich and his wife lu ##dm ##ila arrived in the capital , nay ##py ##ida ##w , the same day as the country received a visit by us secretary of state hillary rod ##ham clinton , who also met with pro - democracy opposition leader au ##ng san su ##u ky ##i . international relations progress indicators continued in september 2012 when au ##ng san su ##u ky ##i visited to the us followed by myanmar ' s reform ##ist president visit to the united nations .
associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in myanmar before 1823 [SEP] the ro ##hing ##ya people have consistently faced human rights abuses by the burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as burmese citizens ( despite some of them having lived in burma for over three generations ) — the ro ##hing ##ya have been denied burmese citizenship since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law . the law created three categories of citizenship : citizenship , associate citizenship , and natural ##ised citizenship . citizenship is given to those who belong to one of the national races such as ka ##chin , kay ##ah ( karen ##ni ) , karen , chin , burma ##n , mon , ra ##kh ##ine , shan , kam ##an , or ze ##rba ##dee . associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in myanmar before 1823 , but can prove they have one grandpa ##rent , or pre - 1823 ancestor , who was a citizen of another country , as well as people who applied for citizenship in 1948 and qualified then by those laws . naturalized citizenship is only given to those who have at least one parent with one of these types of burmese citizenship or can provide " con ##clusive evidence " that their parents entered and resided in burma prior to independence in 1948 . the burmese regime has attempted to forcibly ex ##pel ro ##hing ##ya and bring in non - ro ##hing ##yas to replace them — this policy has resulted in the expulsion of approximately half of the 800 , 000 ro ##hing ##ya from burma , while the ro ##hing ##ya people have been described as " among the world ' s least wanted " and " one of the world ' s most persecuted minorities . " but the origin of ‘ most persecuted minority ’ statement is unclear .
on 10 june 2012 , a state of emergency was declared in ra ##kh ##ine , allowing the military to participate in administration of the region [SEP] the government has responded by imposing cu ##rf ##ew ##s and by deploy ##ing troops in the regions . on 10 june 2012 , a state of emergency was declared in ra ##kh ##ine , allowing the military to participate in administration of the region . the burmese army and police have been accused of targeting ro ##hing ##ya muslims through mass arrests and arbitrary violence . a number of monks ' organisations that played a vital role in myanmar ' s struggle for democracy have taken measures to block any humanitarian assistance to the ro ##hing ##ya community .
improvements in civil liberties and political rights , the release of political prisoners , and a loosen ##ing of restrictions . [SEP] according to the crisis group , since myanmar transitioned to a new government in august 2011 , the country ' s human rights record has been improving . previously giving myanmar its lowest rating of 7 , the 2012 freedom in the world report also notes improvement , giving myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and political rights , the release of political prisoners , and a loosen ##ing of restrictions . in 2013 , myanmar improved yet again , receiving a score of five in civil liberties and a six in political freedoms
ethical quan ##dar ##y of how to work with the government without bo ##lster ##ing or app ##ea ##sing it . [SEP] the government has also relaxed reporting laws , but these remain highly restrictive . in september 2011 , several banned websites , including youtube , democratic voice of burma and voice of america , were un ##block ##ed . a 2011 report by the ha ##user center for nonprofit organizations found that , while contact with the myanmar government was constrained by donor restrictions , international humanitarian non - governmental organisations ( ngos ) see opportunities for effective advocacy with government officials , especially at the local level . at the same time , international ngos are mind ##ful of the ethical quan ##dar ##y of how to work with the government without bo ##lster ##ing or app ##ea ##sing it .
reports of de ##pl ##ora ##ble working conditions in the mines . [SEP] many us and european jewellery companies , including bu ##lga ##ri , tiffany , and cart ##ier , refuse to import these stones based on reports of de ##pl ##ora ##ble working conditions in the mines . human rights watch has encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all profits go to the ruling junta , as the majority of mining activity in the country is government - run . the government of myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines .
due to nearly a century of british and christian presence ##s in myanmar . [SEP] the educational system of myanmar is operated by the government agency , the ministry of education . the education system is based on the united kingdom ' s system due to nearly a century of british and christian presence ##s in myanmar . nearly all schools are government - operated , but there has been a recent increase in privately funded english language schools . schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school , approximately about 9 years old , while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level .
tun she ##in — a leading politician of the 1910s , who campaigned for burmese independence in london . [SEP] myanmar ' s first film was a documentary of the funeral of tun she ##in — a leading politician of the 1910s , who campaigned for burmese independence in london . the first burmese silent film my ##itt ##a ne th ##uy ##a ( love and liquor ) in 1920 which proved a major success , despite its poor quality due to a fixed camera position and inadequate film accessories . during the 1920s and 1930s , many burmese - owned film companies made and produced several films . the first burmese sound film was produced in 1932 in bombay , india with the title ng ##we pay lo ma ya ( money can ' t buy it ) . after world war ii , burmese cinema continued to address political themes . many of the films produced in the early cold war era had a strong propaganda element to them .
as a result of their emigration from europe [SEP] ash ##ken ##azi jews represent the bulk of modern jew ##ry , with at least 70 % of jews worldwide ( and up to 90 % prior to world war ii and the holocaust ) . as a result of their emigration from europe , ash ##ken ##azi ##m also represent the overwhelming majority of jews in the new world continents , in countries such as the united states , canada , argentina , australia , and brazil . in france , the immigration of jews from algeria ( sep ##hard ##im ) has led them to out ##num ##ber the ash ##ken ##azi ##m . only in israel is the jewish population representative of all groups , a melting pot independent of each group ' s proportion within the overall world jewish population .
similarities to wool [SEP] during the late medieval period , cotton became known as an imported fiber in northern europe , without any knowledge of how it was derived , other than that it was a plant . because hero ##dot ##us had written in his histories , book iii , 106 , that in india trees grew in the wild producing wool , it was assumed that the plant was a tree , rather than a shrub . this aspect is retained in the name for cotton in several germanic languages , such as german ba ##um ##wo ##lle , which translates as " tree wool " ( ba ##um means " tree " ; wo ##lle means " wool " ) . noting its similarities to wool , people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant - borne sheep . john man ##dev ##ille , writing in 135 ##0 , stated as fact the now - prep ##ost ##ero ##us belief : " there grew there [ india ] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lamb ##s on the end ##es of its branches . these branches were so pl ##iable that they bent down to allow the lamb ##s to feed when they are hung ##rie [ sic ] . " ( see vegetable lamb of tar ##tary . ) by the end of the 16th century , cotton was cultivated throughout the warmer regions in asia and the americas .
control pest ##s [SEP] successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost - free period , plenty of sunshine , and a moderate rainfall , usually from 600 to 1 , 200 mm ( 24 to 47 in ) . soils usually need to be fairly heavy , although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional . in general , these conditions are met within the seasonal ##ly dry tr ##op ##ics and sub ##tro ##pic ##s in the northern and southern hemisphere ##s , but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation . production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn . cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pest ##s . planting time in spring in the northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of february to the beginning of june . the area of the united states known as the south plains is the largest contiguous cotton - growing region in the world . while dry ##land ( non - ir ##ri ##gated ) cotton is successfully grown in this region , consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the og ##alla ##la a ##qui ##fer . since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant , this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semi ##ari ##d regions . as water resources get tighter around the world , economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict , as well as potential environmental problems . for example , improper crop ##ping and irrigation practices have led to desert ##ification in areas of uzbekistan , where cotton is a major export . in the days of the soviet union , the ara ##l sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation , largely of cotton , and now sal ##ination is widespread .
the system simply issues a short command [SEP] the most powerful used method works by comparing each frame in the video with the previous one . if the frame contains areas where nothing has moved , the system simply issues a short command that copies that part of the previous frame , bit - for - bit , into the next one . if sections of the frame move in a simple manner , the compressor emi ##ts a ( slightly longer ) command that tells the deco ##mp ##ress ##or to shift , rotate , light ##en , or dark ##en the copy . this longer command still remains much shorter than intra ##frame compression . inter ##frame compression works well for programs that will simply be played back by the viewer , but can cause problems if the video sequence needs to be edited .
the extent of argent ##inian casualties became known [SEP] one of the paper ' s best known front pages , published on 4 may 1982 , commemorated the torpedo ##ing of the argentine ship the general bel ##gra ##no by running the story under the headline " got ##cha " . at mackenzie ' s insistence , and against the wishes of murdoch ( the mo ##gul was present because almost all the journalists were on strike ) , the headline was changed for later editions after the extent of argent ##inian casualties became known . john shirley , a reporter for the sunday times , witnessed copies of this edition of the sun being thrown overboard by sailors and marines on hms fearless .
peter man ##del ##son was " out ##ed " by matthew par ##ris [SEP] in exchange for rupert murdoch ' s support , blair agreed not to join the european exchange rate mechanism – which john major had withdrawn the country from in september 1992 after barely two years . cabinet minister peter man ##del ##son was " out ##ed " by matthew par ##ris ( a former sun columnist ) on bbc tv ' s news ##night in november 1998 . mis ##ju ##d ##ging public response , the sun ' s editor david yell ##and demanded to know in a front page editorial whether britain was governed by a " gay mafia " of a " closed world of men with a mutual self - interest " . three days later the paper ap ##olo ##gis ##ed in another editorial which said the sun would never again reveal a person ' s sexuality unless it could be defended on the grounds of " overwhelming public interest " .
as part of a probe in which journalists paid police officers for information [SEP] on 28 january 2012 , police arrested four current and former staff members of the sun , as part of a probe in which journalists paid police officers for information ; a police officer was also arrested in the probe . the sun staff ##ers arrested were crime editor mike sullivan , head of news chris ph ##aro , former deputy editor fergus shan ##aha ##n , and former managing editor graham du ##dman , who since became a columnist and media writer . all five arrested were held on suspicion of corruption . police also searched the offices of news international , the publishers of the sun , as part of a continuing investigation into the news of the world scandal .
page 3 returned to its usual format [SEP] in august 2013 , the irish sun ended the practice of featuring top ##less models on page 3 . the main newspaper was reported to have followed in 2015 with the edition of 16 january supposedly the last to carry such photographs after a report in the times made such an assertion . after substantial coverage in the media about an alleged change in editorial policy , page 3 returned to its usual format on 22 january 2015 . a few hours before the issue was published , the head of pr at the newspaper said the reputed end of page 3 had been " speculation " only .
because of their persistence and potential to bio ##ac ##cum ##ulate [SEP] many pest ##icides can be grouped into chemical families . prominent insect ##icide families include organ ##och ##lor ##ines , organ ##op ##hos ##phate ##s , and car ##ba ##mates . organ ##och ##lor ##ine hydro ##carbon ##s ( e . g . , dd ##t ) could be separated into di ##ch ##lor ##od ##ip ##hen ##yle ##than ##es , cy ##cl ##od ##ien ##e compounds , and other related compounds . they operate by disrupt ##ing the sodium / potassium balance of the nerve fiber , forcing the nerve to transmit continuously . their toxic ##ities vary greatly , but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to bio ##ac ##cum ##ulate . : 239 – 240 organ ##op ##hos ##phate and car ##ba ##mates largely replaced organ ##och ##lor ##ines . both operate through inhibit ##ing the enzyme ace ##ty ##lch ##olin ##ester ##ase , allowing ace ##ty ##lch ##olin ##e to transfer nerve impulse ##s indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis . organ ##op ##hos ##phate ##s are quite toxic to ve ##rte ##brates , and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic car ##ba ##mates . : 136 – 137 th ##io ##car ##ba ##mate and di ##thi ##oca ##rba ##mates are sub ##class ##es of car ##ba ##mates . prominent families of herb ##icides include ph ##eno ##xy and benz ##oic acid herb ##icides ( e . g . 2 , 4 - d ) , tri ##azi ##nes ( e . g . , at ##raz ##ine ) , ur ##ea ##s ( e . g . , di ##uron ) , and ch ##lor ##oa ##ce ##tani ##lide ##s ( e . g . , ala ##ch ##lor ) . ph ##eno ##xy compounds tend to selective ##ly kill broad - leaf weeds rather than grasses . the ph ##eno ##xy and benz ##oic acid herb ##icides function similar to plant growth hormones , and grow cells without normal cell division , crushing the plant ' s nutrient transport system . : 300 tri ##azi ##nes interfere with photos ##yn ##thesis . : 335 many commonly used pest ##icides are not included in these families , including g ##ly ##ph ##osa ##te .
inadequate regulation [SEP] the world health organization and the un environment programme estimate that each year , 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience severe poisoning from pest ##icides , about 18 , 000 of whom die . owing to inadequate regulation and safety precautions , 99 % of pest ##icide related deaths occur in developing countries that account for only 25 % of pest ##icide usage . according to one study , as many as 25 million workers in developing countries may suffer mild pest ##icide poisoning yearly . there are several careers aside from agriculture that may also put individuals at risk of health effects from pest ##icide exposure including pet groom ##ers , grounds ##keepers , and fu ##mi ##gat ##ors .
potentially con ##tam ##inating [SEP] pest ##icide use raises a number of environmental concerns . over 98 % of sprayed insect ##icides and 95 % of herb ##icides reach a destination other than their target species , including non - target species , air , water and soil . pest ##icide drift occurs when pest ##icides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas , potentially con ##tam ##inating them . pest ##icides are one of the causes of water pollution , and some pest ##icides are persistent organic poll ##uta ##nts and contribute to soil contamination .
dissolve in fat ##s [SEP] since ch ##lor ##inated hydro ##carbon pest ##icides dissolve in fat ##s and are not ex ##cre ##ted , organisms tend to retain them almost indefinitely . biological mag ##ni ##fication is the process whereby these ch ##lor ##inated hydro ##carbon ##s ( pest ##icides ) are more concentrated at each level of the food chain . among marine animals , pest ##icide concentrations are higher in car ##nivorous fishes , and even more so in the fish - eating birds and mammals at the top of the ecological pyramid . global di ##sti ##llation is the process whereby pest ##icides are transported from warmer to colder regions of the earth , in particular the poles and mountain tops . pest ##icides that eva ##por ##ate into the atmosphere at relatively high temperature can be carried considerable distances ( thousands of kilometers ) by the wind to an area of lower temperature , where they conde ##nse and are carried back to the ground in rain or snow .
safer than traditional chemical pest ##icides [SEP] alternatives to pest ##icides are available and include methods of cultivation , use of biological pest controls ( such as ph ##ero ##mon ##es and micro ##bial pest ##icides ) , genetic engineering , and methods of interfering with insect breeding . application of com ##post ##ed yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pest ##s . these methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pest ##icides . in addition , epa is registering reduced - risk conventional pest ##icides in increasing numbers .
deco ##y towns were constructed in somerset in world war ii to protect bristol and other towns , at night [SEP] a number of deco ##y towns were constructed in somerset in world war ii to protect bristol and other towns , at night . they were designed to mimic the geometry of " black ##ed out " streets , railway lines , and bristol temple mead ##s railway station , to encourage bombers away from these targets . one , on the radio beam flight path to bristol , was constructed on beacon batch . it was laid out by she ##pper ##ton studios , based on aerial photographs of the city ' s railway marshall ##ing yards . the deco ##ys were fitted with dim red lights , sim ##ulating activities like the st ##oki ##ng of steam locomotives . burning bal ##es of straw soaked in cr ##eo ##so ##te were used to simulate the effects of inc ##end ##iary bombs dropped by the first wave of path ##finder night bombers ; meanwhile , inc ##end ##iary bombs dropped on the correct location were quickly sm ##oth ##ered , wherever possible . drums of oil were also ignited to simulate the effect of a blazing city or town , with the aim of fool ##ing subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs on the wrong location . the chew magna deco ##y town was hit by half - a - dozen bombs on 2 december 1940 , and over a thousand inc ##end ##ia ##ries on 3 january 1941 . the following night the up ##hill deco ##y town , protecting weston - super - mare ' s airfield , was bombed ; a herd of dairy cows was hit , killing some and severely injuring others .
the work was transferred to lower - wage areas , such as china and asia [SEP] towns such as castle cary and from ##e grew around the medieval weaving industry . street developed as a centre for the production of wool ##len slip ##pers and , later , boots and shoes , with c . & j . clark establishing its headquarters in the town . c & j clark ' s shoes are no longer manufactured there as the work was transferred to lower - wage areas , such as china and asia . instead , in 1993 , redundant factory buildings were converted to form clark ##s village , the first purpose - built factory outlet in the uk . c & j clark also had shoe factories , at one time at br ##id ##g ##water , mine ##head , westfield and weston super mare to provide employment outside the main summer tourist season , but those satellite sites were closed in the late 1980s , before the main site at street . dr . mart ##ens shoes were also made in somerset , by the northampton - based r . gr ##ig ##gs group , using redundant skilled shoe ##makers from c & j clark ; that work has also been transferred to asia .
to reduce the cost of transportation of coal and other heavy produce [SEP] the somerset coal canal was built in the early 19th century to reduce the cost of transportation of coal and other heavy produce . the first 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) , running from a junction with the ken ##net and avon canal , along the cam valley , to a terminal basin at paul ##ton , were in use by 1805 , together with several tramway ##s . a planned 11 . 7 km ( 7 . 3 mi ) branch to mid ##ford was never built , but in 1815 a tramway was laid along its towing path . in 1871 the tramway was purchased by the somerset and dorset joint railway ( s & dj ##r ) , and operated until the 1950s .
recognition of a gift from eli ##hu yale [SEP] yale university is an american private ivy league research university in new haven , connecticut . founded in 1701 in say ##brook colony as the collegiate school , the university is the third - oldest institution of higher education in the united states . the school was renamed yale college in 1718 in recognition of a gift from eli ##hu yale , who was governor of the british east india company . established to train congregational ##ist ministers in theology and sacred languages , by 1777 the school ' s curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences . in the 19th century the school incorporated graduate and professional instruction , awarding the first ph . d . in the united states in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887 .
to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for connecticut [SEP] yale traces its beginnings to " an act for liberty to erect a collegiate school , " passed by the general court of the colony of connecticut on october 9 , 1701 , while meeting in new haven . the act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for connecticut . soon thereafter , a group of ten congregational ##ist ministers : samuel andrew , thomas buckingham , israel cha ##un ##cy , samuel math ##er , rev . james no ##yes ii ( son of james no ##yes ) , james pier ##pon ##t , abraham piers ##on , no ##adia ##h russell , joseph webb and timothy wood ##bridge , all alumni of harvard , met in the study of reverend samuel russell in bran ##ford , connecticut , to pool their books to form the school ' s library . the group , led by james pier ##pon ##t , is now known as " the founders " . [ citation needed ]
the classics would not be abandoned [SEP] the yale report of 1828 was a dog ##matic defense of the latin and greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages , mathematics , and science . unlike higher education in europe , there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the united states . in the competition for students and financial support , college leaders st ##rove to keep current with demands for innovation . at the same time , they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background . the yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned . all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum , often resulting in a dual track . in the decent ##ral ##ized environment of higher education in the united states , balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical . a group of professors at yale and new haven congregational ##ist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the victorian culture . they concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptation ##s from within , yet flexible enough to adjust to the ' is ##ms ' ( professional ##ism , material ##ism , individual ##ism , and consumer ##ism ) tempting him from without . william graham sumner , professor from 1872 to 1909 , taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to over ##flow ##ing classrooms . he best ##ed president noah porter , who disliked social science and wanted yale to lock into its traditions of classical education . porter objected to sumner ' s use of a textbook by herbert spencer that es ##po ##used ag ##nostic material ##ism because it might harm students .
scoring is subjective [SEP] between 1892 , when harvard and yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates , and 1909 , the year of the first triangular debate of harvard , yale , and princeton , the rhetoric , symbolism , and metaphor ##s used in athletics were used to frame these early debates . debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbook ##s , and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets . there even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches . yet , the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed . one reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner , as is the case in sports , and that scoring is subjective . in addition , with late 19th - century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body , athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart .
expansion [SEP] expansion caused controversy about yale ' s new roles . noah porter , moral philosopher , was president from 1871 to 1886 . during an age of tremendous expansion in higher education , porter resisted the rise of the new research university , claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education . many of porter ' s contemporaries criticized his administration , and historians since have di ##spar ##aged his leadership . lev ##es ##que argues porter was not a simple - minded reaction ##ary , un ##cr ##itical ##ly committed to tradition , but a principle ##d and selective conservative . he did not end ##ors ##e everything old or reject everything new ; rather , he sought to apply long - established ethical and pe ##da ##go ##gical principles to a rapidly changing culture . he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time , but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university .
to celebrate the ' values ' of the western united states [SEP] the american studies program reflected the worldwide anti - communist ideological struggle . norman holmes pearson , who worked for the office of strategic studies in london during world war ii , returned to yale and headed the new american studies program , in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty . popular among undergraduate ##s , the program sought to ins ##truct them in the fundamental ##s of american civilization and thereby ins ##till a sense of nationalism and national purpose . also during the 1940s and 1950s , wyoming millionaire william robertson coe made large contributions to the american studies programs at yale university and at the university of wyoming . coe was concerned to celebrate the ' values ' of the western united states in order to meet the " threat of communism . "
exemption from local property taxes [SEP] yale has a complicated relationship with its home city ; for example , thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations , but city officials , who dec ##ry yale ' s exemption from local property taxes , have long pressed the university to do more to help . under president levin , yale has financially supported many of new haven ' s efforts to rein ##vi ##gor ##ate the city . evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial . still , the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy .
yale ’ s focus on creating " a laboratory for future leaders , " [SEP] several explanations have been offered for yale ’ s representation in national elections since the end of the vietnam war . various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at yale since the 1960s , and the intellectual influence of reverend william sloane coffin on many of the future candidates . yale president richard levin attributes the run to yale ’ s focus on creating " a laboratory for future leaders , " an institutional priority that began during the tenure of yale presidents alfred whitney gr ##is ##wo ##ld and king ##man brewster . richard h . bro ##dh ##ead , former dean of yale college and now president of duke university , stated : " we do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions , and there is a very strong tradition of volunteer ##ism at yale . " yale historian ga ##dd ##is smith notes " an et ##hos of organized activity " at yale during the 20th century that led john kerry to lead the yale political union ' s liberal party , george pat ##aki the conservative party , and joseph lie ##berman to manage the yale daily news . camille pa ##glia points to a history of networking and eli ##tism : " it has to do with a web of friendships and affiliation ##s built up in school . " cnn suggests that george w . bush benefited from prefer ##ential admissions policies for the " son and grandson of alumni " , and for a " member of a politically influential family . " new york times correspondent elisabeth bum ##ille ##r and the atlantic monthly correspondent james fall ##ows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students , faculty , and administration , which down ##play ##s self - interest and reinforce ##s commitment to others .

first class to have women in it [SEP] during the 1988 presidential election , george h . w . bush ( yale ' 48 ) der ##ided michael du ##ka ##kis for having " foreign - policy views born in harvard yard ' s boutique " . when challenged on the distinction between du ##ka ##kis ' s harvard connection and his own yale background , he said that , unlike harvard , yale ' s reputation was " so diffuse , there isn ' t a symbol , i don ' t think , in the yale situation , any symbolism in it " and said yale did not share harvard ' s reputation for " liberalism and eli ##tism " . in 2004 howard dean stated , " in some ways , i consider myself separate from the other three ( yale ) candidates of 2004 . yale changed so much between the class of ' 68 and the class of ' 71 . my class was the first class to have women in it ; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit african americans . it was an extraordinary time , and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation " .
he came to the defense of a student who was involved in campus labor issues . [SEP] yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations , often culminating in strikes . there have been at least eight strikes since 1968 , and the new york times wrote that yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the u . s . yale ' s unusually large endowment ex ##ace ##rba ##tes the tension over wages . moreover , yale has been accused of failing to treat workers with respect . in a 2003 strike , however , the university claimed that more union employees were working than striking . professor david gr ##ae ##ber was ' retired ' after he came to the defense of a student who was involved in campus labor issues .
que ##ll unrest between students and city residents [SEP] several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at yale . the first campus police force was founded at yale in 1894 , when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus . later hired by the university , the officers were originally brought in to que ##ll unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior . in addition to the yale police department , a variety of safety services are available including blue phones , a safety escort , and 24 - hour shuttle service .
a slave - owner and strong slavery supporter in the nineteenth century [SEP] in the wake of the racial ##ly - motivated " church shooting in charleston , south carolina , yale was under criticism again in the summer of 2015 for calhoun college , one of 12 residential colleges , which was named after john c . calhoun , a slave - owner and strong slavery supporter in the nineteenth century . in july 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change . they argued in the petition that — while calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an " extraordinary american statesman " — he was " one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy " in the history of the united states . in august 2015 yale president peter sal ##ove ##y addressed the freshman class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed . he described calhoun as a " a notable political theorist , a vice president to two different u . s . presidents , a secretary of war and of state , and a congressman and senator representing south carolina . " he acknowledged that calhoun also " believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary ser ##vi ##tu ##de . not only that , but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior , black people in particular , ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests . " racial tensions increased in the fall of 2015 center ##ing on comments by nicholas a . christ ##aki ##s and his wife erika regarding freedom of speech . in april 2016 sal ##ove ##y announced that " despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests , " calhoun ' s name will remain on the yale residential college explaining that it is prefer ##able for yale students to live in calhoun ' s " shadow " so they will be " better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future . " he claimed that if they removed calhoun ' s name , it would " obscure " his " legacy of slavery rather than addressing it . " " yale is part of that history " and " we cannot erase american history , but we can confront it , teach it and learn from it . " one change that will be issued is the title of “ master ” for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to “ head of college ” due to its con ##not ##ation of slavery .
demographic crisis [SEP] though there is no doubt that the demographic crisis of the 14th century caused a dramatic fall in production and commerce in absolute terms , there has been a vigorous historical debate over whether the decline was greater than the fall in population . while the older orthodoxy held that the artistic output of the renaissance was a result of greater op ##ule ##nce , more recent studies have suggested that there might have been a so - called ' depression of the renaissance ' . in spite of convincing arguments for the case , the statistical evidence is simply too incomplete for a definite conclusion to be made .
larger churches are considered price ##less works of art [SEP] it is in the great churches and cathedral ##s and in a number of civic buildings that the gothic style was expressed most powerful ##ly , its characteristics lending themselves to appeals to the emotions , whether spring ##ing from faith or from civic pride . a great number of ecclesiastical buildings remain from this period , of which even the smallest are often structures of architectural distinction while many of the larger churches are considered price ##less works of art and are listed with unesco as world heritage sites . for this reason a study of gothic architecture is largely a study of cathedral ##s and churches .
proximity of some regions [SEP] from the 10th to the 13th century , romanesque architecture had become a pan - european style and manner of construction , affecting buildings in countries as far apart as ireland , croatia , sweden and sicily . the same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of gothic architecture , but the acceptance of the gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place , as did the expressions of gothic taste . the proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style . on the other hand , some regions such as england and spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere , except where they have been carried by it ##iner ##ant craftsmen , or the transfer of bishops . regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedral ##s of the romanesque period often become even more apparent in the gothic .
because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble [SEP] in northern germany , netherlands , northern poland , denmark , and the baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was a strong tradition of building in brick . the resultant style , brick gothic , is called " backs ##tein ##go ##ti ##k " in germany and scandinavia and is associated with the hans ##ea ##tic league . in italy , stone was used for fortifications , but brick was preferred for other buildings . because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble , many buildings were faced in marble , or were left with und ##ec ##ora ##ted facade so that this might be achieved at a later date .
to ease the problem of congestion [SEP] su ##ger , friend and con ##fi ##dant of the french kings , louis vi and louis vii , decided in about 113 ##7 , to rebuild the great church of saint - denis , attached to an abbey which was also a royal residence . he began with the west front , rec ##ons ##tructing the original carol ##ing ##ian facade with its single door . he designed the facade of saint - denis to be an echo of the roman arch of constantine with its three - part division and three large portals to ease the problem of congestion . the rose window is the earliest - known example above the west portal in france . the facade combines both round arches and pointed arches of the gothic style .
they will be soluble , di ##sso ##lving into the mixture [SEP] an alloy is a mixture of either pure or fairly pure chemical elements , which forms an imp ##ure substance ( ad ##mi ##xt ##ure ) that retains the characteristics of a metal . an alloy is distinct from an imp ##ure metal , such as wrought iron , in that , with an alloy , the added imp ##urities are usually desirable and will typically have some useful benefit . alloys are made by mixing two or more elements ; at least one of which being a metal . this is usually called the primary metal or the base metal , and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy . the other constituents may or may not be metals but , when mixed with the molten base , they will be soluble , di ##sso ##lving into the mixture .
if the metals remain soluble when solid [SEP] although the elements usually must be soluble in the liquid state , they may not always be soluble in the solid state . if the metals remain soluble when solid , the alloy forms a solid solution , becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals , called a phase . if the mixture cool ##s and the constituents become ins ##ol ##ub ##le , they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals , creating a het ##ero ##gen ##eous micro ##st ##ru ##cture of different phases . however , in other alloys , the ins ##ol ##ub ##le elements may not separate until after crystal ##lization occurs . these alloys are called inter ##met ##all ##ic alloys because , if cooled very quickly , they first crystal ##li ##ze as a homogeneous phase , but they are super ##sat ##ura ##ted with the secondary constituents . as time passes , the atoms of these super ##sat ##ura ##ted alloys separate within the crystals , forming inter ##met ##all ##ic phases that serve to reinforce the crystals internally .
too soft [SEP] the term pew ##ter covers a variety of alloys consisting primarily of tin . as a pure metal , tin was much too soft to be used for any practical purpose . however , in the bronze age , tin was a rare metal and , in many parts of europe and the mediterranean , was often valued higher than gold . to make jewelry , forks and spoon ##s , or other objects from tin , it was usually alloy ##ed with other metals to increase its strength and hardness . these metals were typically lead , anti ##mony , bis ##mut ##h or copper . these sol ##ute ##s sometimes were added individually in varying amounts , or added together , making a wide variety of things , ranging from practical items , like dishes , surgical tools , candles ##tick ##s or funnel ##s , to decorative items such as ear rings and hair clips .
harden over time [SEP] in 1906 , precipitation harden ##ing alloys were discovered by alfred wil ##m . precipitation harden ##ing alloys , such as certain alloys of aluminium , titanium , and copper , are heat - treat ##able alloys that soft ##en when que ##nched ( cooled quickly ) , and then harden over time . after que ##nch ##ing a ter ##nary alloy of aluminium , copper , and magnesium , wil ##m discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature . although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919 , du ##ral ##umi ##n was one of the first " age harden ##ing " alloys to be used , and was soon followed by many others . because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight , these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry , including the construction of modern aircraft .
it was too remote and difficult for shipping and too costly to maintain [SEP] as early as 1794 , lieutenant - governor of new south wales francis gr ##ose suggested its closure as a penal settlement , as it was too remote and difficult for shipping and too costly to maintain . the first group of people left in february 1805 , and by 1808 only about 200 remained , forming a small settlement until the remnants were removed in 1813 . a small party remained to slaughter stock and destroy all buildings , so that there would be no induce ##ment for anyone , especially from other european powers , to visit and lay claim to the place . from 15 february 1814 to 6 june 1825 the island was abandoned .

political reasons [SEP] richard hu ##rd believed that burke ' s imitation was near - perfect and that this defeated his purpose : an iron ##ist " should take care by a constant ex ##agger ##ation to make the rid ##ic ##ule shine through the imitation . whereas this vin ##dication is everywhere en ##for ##c ' d , not only in the language , and on the principles of l . bo ##l . , but with so apparent , or rather so real an earnest ##ness , that half his purpose is sacrificed to the other " . a minority of scholars have taken the position that , in fact , burke did write the vin ##dication in earnest , later di ##so ##wn ##ing it only for political reasons .
to minimize overall weight and size [SEP] to minimize overall weight and size , miniature pm motors may use high energy magnet ##s made with neo ##dy ##mium or other strategic elements ; most such are neo ##dy ##mium - iron - bo ##ron alloy . with their higher flux density , electric machines with high - energy pm ##s are at least competitive with all optimal ##ly designed sing ##ly - fed sync ##hr ##ono ##us and induction electric machines . miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration , except that they have at least three rotor poles ( to ensure starting , regardless of rotor position ) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetic ##ally links the exterior ##s of the curved field magnet ##s .
precision and speed limitations [SEP] steppe ##r motors can be rotated to a specific angle in discrete steps with ease , and hence steppe ##r motors are used for read / write head positioning in computer floppy disk ##ette drives . they were used for the same purpose in pre - gig ##aby ##te era computer disk drives , where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read / write head of a hard disk drive . as drive density increased , the precision and speed limitations of steppe ##r motors made them obsolete for hard drives — the precision limitation made them un ##usa ##ble , and the speed limitation made them un ##com ##pet ##itive — thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil - based head act ##ua ##tor systems . ( the term " voice coil " in this connection is historic ; it refers to the structure in a typical ( cone type ) loud ##sp ##eak ##er . this structure was used for a while to position the heads . modern drives have a pi ##vot ##ed coil mount ; the coil swings back and forth , something like a blade of a rotating fan . nevertheless , like a voice coil , modern act ##ua ##tor coil conductors ( the magnet wire ) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force . )
finance and licensing [SEP] the government ex ##ert ##s greater control over broadcast media than print media , especially due to finance and licensing . the swiss broadcasting corporation , whose name was recently changed to sr ##g ssr , is charged with the production and broadcast of radio and television programs . sr ##g ssr studios are distributed throughout the various language regions . radio content is produced in six central and four regional studios while the television programs are produced in geneva , zurich and lu ##gano . an extensive cable network also allows most swiss to access the programs from neighboring countries .
research triangle park [SEP] raleigh is an early example in the united states of a planned city , chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such . the city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the north carolina state capitol in union square at the center . in the united states civil war the city was spared from any significant battle , only falling in the closing days of the war , though it did not escape the economic hardship ##s that plagued the rest of the american south during the reconstruction era . the twentieth century saw the opening of the research triangle park in 1959 , and with the jobs it created the region and city saw a large influx of population , making it one of the fastest growing communities in the united states by the early 21st century .
state legislators . [SEP] the city ' s location was chosen , in part , for being within 11 mi ( 18 km ) of isaac hunter ' s tavern , a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators . no known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site . raleigh is one of the few cities in the united states that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital . its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of north , east , west and south streets . the plan , a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner , was based on thomas holm ##e ' s 1682 plan for philadelphia .
a state economy based on agriculture , [SEP] after the civil war began , governor ze ##bu ##lon baird vance ordered the construction of breast ##works around the city as protection from union troops . during general sherman ' s carolina ##s campaign , raleigh was captured by union cavalry under the command of general hugh ju ##dson ki ##lp ##at ##rick on april 13 , 1865 . as the confederate cavalry retreated west , the union soldiers followed , leading to the nearby battle of morris ##ville . the city was spared significant destruction during the war , but due to the economic problems of the post - war period and reconstruction , with a state economy based on agriculture , it grew little over the next several decades .
the state legislature passed a new constitution [SEP] in the late nineteenth century , two black congress ##men were elected from north carolina ' s 2nd district , the last in 1898 . george henry white sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white democrats to reduce black voting by new disc ##rim ##inatory laws . they were unsuccessful . in 1900 , the state legislature passed a new constitution , with voter registration rules that di ##sf ##ran ##chi ##sed most blacks and many poor whites . the state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908 . loss of the ability to vote disqualified black men ( and later women ) from sitting on ju ##ries and serving in any office , local , state or federal . the rising black middle - class in raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance , and the republican party was no longer competitive . it was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid - 1960s that the majority of blacks in north carolina would again be able to vote , sit on ju ##ries and serve in local offices . no african american was elected to congress until 1992 .
cold air dam ##ming [SEP] raleigh receives an average of 6 . 0 inches ( 15 . 2 cm ) of snow in winter . freezing rain and sl ##eet also occur most winters , and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm . on january 24 – 25 , 2000 , raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm – 20 . 3 inches ( 52 cm ) – the winter storm of january 2000 . storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air dam ##ming that affects the city due to its proximity to the appalachian mountains . winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well .
discarded [SEP] it is possible with protein combinations of two incomplete protein sources ( e . g . , rice and beans ) to make a complete protein source , and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions . however , complementary sources of protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body . excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called g ##lu ##con ##eo ##genesis . the amino acids remaining after such conversion are discarded .
to promote year - round trade and a year - round navy [SEP] for over 200 years , russia had been expanding southward ##s across the sparsely populated " wild fields " toward the warm water ports of the black sea that did not freeze over like the handful of other ports available in the north . the goal was to promote year - round trade and a year - round navy . : 11 pursuit of this goal brought the emerging russian state into conflict with the ukrainian co ##ssa ##cks and then with the tatar ##s of the crimean khan ##ate and circa ##ssi ##ans . when russia conquered these groups and gained possession of southern ukraine , known as new russia during russian imperial times , the ottoman empire lost its buffer zone against russian expansion , and russia and the ottoman empire fell into direct conflict . the conflict with the ottoman empire also presented a religious issue of importance , as russia saw itself as the protector of orthodox christians , many of whom lived under ottoman control and were treated as second - class citizens . ( ch 1 )
russia ' s rejection of the ultimatum [SEP] nicholas felt that , because of russian assistance in suppress ##ing the hungarian revolution of 1848 , austria would side with him , or at the very least remain neutral . austria , however , felt threatened by the russian troops in the balkans . on 27 february 1854 , the united kingdom and france demanded the withdrawal of russian forces from the principal ##ities ; austria supported them and , though it did not declare war on russia , it refused to guarantee its neutrality . russia ' s rejection of the ultimatum caused the uk and france to enter the war .
to reinforce batteries on shore [SEP] in june , the fleets transported the allied expeditionary forces to var ##na , in support of the ottoman operations on the danube ; in september they again transported the armies , this time to the crimea . the russian fleet during this time declined to engage the allies , preferring to maintain a " fleet in being " ; this strategy failed when se ##vas ##top ##ol , the main port and where most of the black sea fleet was based , came under siege . the russians were reduced to sc ##ut ##tling their warships as blocks ##hips , after stripping them of their guns and men to reinforce batteries on shore . during the siege , the russians lost four 110 - or 120 - gun , three - decker ships of the line , twelve 84 - gun two - decker ##s and four 60 - gun frigates in the black sea , plus a large number of smaller vessels . during the rest of the campaign the allied fleets remained in control of the black sea , ensuring the various fronts were kept supplied .
a storm [SEP] winter , and a deteriorating supply situation on both sides of troops and mater ##iel , led to a halt in ground operations . se ##vas ##top ##ol remained invested by the allies , while the allied armies were hem ##med in by the russian army in the interior . on 14 november a storm sank thirty allied transport ships including hms prince which was carrying a cargo of winter clothing . : 435 the storm and heavy traffic caused the road from the coast to the troops to di ##sin ##te ##grate into a qu ##ag ##mir ##e , requiring engineers to devote most of their time to its repair including quarry ##ing stone . a tram ##ro ##ad was ordered . it arrived in january with a civilian engineering crew , however it was march before it was sufficiently advanced to be of any app ##re ##cia ##ble value . : 43 ##9 an electrical telegraph was also ordered , but the frozen ground delayed its installation until march , when communications from the base port of bala ##kla ##va to the british hq was established . the pipe - and - cable - laying pl ##ough failed because of the hard frozen soil , but even so 21 miles of cable were laid . : 44 ##9
the frozen ground [SEP] winter , and a deteriorating supply situation on both sides of troops and mater ##iel , led to a halt in ground operations . se ##vas ##top ##ol remained invested by the allies , while the allied armies were hem ##med in by the russian army in the interior . on 14 november a storm sank thirty allied transport ships including hms prince which was carrying a cargo of winter clothing . : 435 the storm and heavy traffic caused the road from the coast to the troops to di ##sin ##te ##grate into a qu ##ag ##mir ##e , requiring engineers to devote most of their time to its repair including quarry ##ing stone . a tram ##ro ##ad was ordered . it arrived in january with a civilian engineering crew , however it was march before it was sufficiently advanced to be of any app ##re ##cia ##ble value . : 43 ##9 an electrical telegraph was also ordered , but the frozen ground delayed its installation until march , when communications from the base port of bala ##kla ##va to the british hq was established . the pipe - and - cable - laying pl ##ough failed because of the hard frozen soil , but even so 21 miles of cable were laid . : 44 ##9
a fisherman who moved bu ##oys [SEP] in july 1855 , the allied squadron tried to go past tag ##an ##ro ##g to ro ##stov on don , entering the don river through the mi ##us river . on 12 july 1855 hms jasper grounded near tag ##an ##ro ##g thanks to a fisherman who moved bu ##oys into shallow water . the co ##ssa ##cks captured the gun ##boat with all of its guns and blew it up . the third siege attempt was made 19 – 31 august 1855 , but the city was already fortified and the squadron could not approach close enough for landing operations . the allied fleet left the gulf of tag ##an ##ro ##g on the 2nd september 1855 , with minor military operations along the az ##ov sea coast continuing until late autumn 1855 .

disease [SEP] 1855 : ka ##rs : in the year up to may 1855 turkish forces in the east were reduced from 120 , 000 to 75 , 000 , mostly by disease . the local armenian population kept mu ##ra ##vy ##ev well - informed about the turks at ka ##rs and he judged they had about five months of supplies . he therefore decided to control the surrounding area with cavalry and star ##ve them out . he started in may and by june was south and west of the town . a re ##lie ##ving force fell back and there was a possibility of taking er ##zer ##um , but mu ##ra ##vy ##ev chose not to . in late september he learned of the fall of se ##vas ##top ##ol and a turkish landing at bat ##um . this led him to reverse policy and try a direct attack . it failed , the russians losing 800 ##0 men and the turks 1500 ( 29 september ) . the blockade continued and ka ##rs surrendered on 8 november .
losing its tax exempt status [SEP] after a nonprofit organization has been formed at the state level , the organization may seek recognition of tax exempt status with respect to u . s . federal income tax . that is done typically by applying to the internal revenue service ( irs ) , although statutory exemption ##s exist for limited types of nonprofit organizations . the irs , after reviewing the application to ensure the organization meets the conditions to be recognized as a tax exempt organization ( such as the purpose , limitations on spending , and internal safeguard ##s for a charity ) , may issue an authorization letter to the nonprofit granting it tax exempt status for income tax payment , filing , and de ##du ##ct ##ibility purposes . the exemption does not apply to other federal taxes such as employment taxes . additionally , a tax - exempt organization must pay federal tax on income that is unrelated to their exempt purpose . failure to maintain operations in conform ##ity to the laws may result in an organization losing its tax exempt status .
taboo word that np ##os or others don ' t like to associate with such community benefit organizations [SEP] many nonprofit organizations find it difficult to create consistent messaging that res ##onate ##s with their various stakeholders as marketing budgets are minimal or none ##xi ##sten ##t . marketing is in many cases a taboo word that np ##os or others don ' t like to associate with such community benefit organizations . there are strategic ways in which nonprofit ##s can leverage their access to various community stakeholders to get their name and cause recognized by the public , but it is imperative to have an outreach strategy which includes a financial plan to execute that outreach / marketing strategy , particularly if the organization has plans to re ##brand or expand their in ##itia ##ives .
to re - experience the emotional psychology she experienced as a child [SEP] literature allows readers to access intimate emotional aspects of a person ’ s character that would not be obvious otherwise . it benefits the psychological development and understanding of the reader . for example , it allows a person to access emotional states from which the person has distance ##d himself or herself . an entry written by d . mitchell featured in ‘ ‘ the english journal ’ ’ explains how the author utilized young adult literature in order to re - experience the emotional psychology she experienced as a child which she describes as a state of “ wonder ” .
neurological development [SEP] mas ##low ’ s ‘ ‘ third force psychology theory ’ ’ even allows literary analysts to critically understand how characters reflect the culture and the history in which they are context ##ual ##ized . it also allows analysts to understand the author ’ s intended message and to understand the author ’ s psychology . the theory suggests that human beings possess a nature within them that demonstrates their true “ self ” and it suggests that the fulfillment of this nature is the reason for living . it also suggests that neurological development hind ##ers actual ##izing the nature because a person becomes estranged from his or her true self . therefore , literary devices reflect a characters ’ s and an author ’ s natural self . in his ‘ ‘ third force psychology and the study of literature ’ ’ , paris argues “ d . h lawrence ’ s “ pristine unconscious ” is a metaphor for the real self ” . thus literature is a rep ##utable tool that allows readers to develop and apply critical reasoning to the nature of emotions .
to surprise the reader [SEP] a literary technique or literary device can be used by authors in order to enhance the written framework of a piece of literature , and produce specific effects . literary techniques encompass a wide range of approaches to craft ##ing a work : whether a work is narrated in first - person or from another perspective , whether to use a traditional linear narrative or a nonlinear narrative , or the choice of literary genre , are all examples of literary technique . they may indicate to a reader that there is a familiar structure and presentation to a work , such as a conventional murder - mystery novel ; or , the author may choose to experiment with their technique to surprise the reader .
to conceal the sources of his knowledge [SEP] ibn sin ##a ' s first appointment was that of physician to the emir , nu ##h ii , who owed him his recovery from a dangerous illness ( 99 ##7 ) . ibn sin ##a ' s chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the sam ##ani ##ds , well - known patrons of scholarship and scholars . when the library was destroyed by fire not long after , the enemies of ibn sin ##a accused him of burning it , in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge . meanwhile , he assisted his father in his financial labor ##s , but still found time to write some of his earliest works .
they sometimes selected different characters for a syllable [SEP] written japanese also includes a pair of sy ##lla ##bari ##es known as kan ##a , derived by sim ##plify ##ing chinese characters selected to represent syllables of japanese . the sy ##lla ##bari ##es differ because they sometimes selected different characters for a syllable , and because they used different strategies to reduce these characters for easy writing : the angular kata ##kan ##a were obtained by selecting a part of each character , while hi ##ragan ##a were derived from the cu ##rs ##ive forms of whole characters . modern japanese writing uses a composite system , using kan ##ji for word stems , hi ##ragan ##a for in ##fle ##xi ##onal endings and grammatical words , and kata ##kan ##a to trans ##cr ##ibe non - chinese loan ##words as well as serve as a method to emphasize native words ( similar to how italics are used in romance languages ) .
a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d or mysterious circumstances . [SEP] bermuda ' s economy is based on offshore insurance and reins ##urance , and tourism , the two largest economic sectors . bermuda had one of the world ' s highest gdp per capita for most of the 20th century and several years beyond . recently , its economic status has been affected by the global recession . it has a subtropical climate . bermuda is the northernmost point of the bermuda triangle , a region of sea in which , according to legend , a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d or mysterious circumstances . the island is in the hurricane belt and prone to severe weather . however , it is somewhat protected from the full force of a hurricane by the coral reef that surrounds the island .

periods of complete sub ##mer ##gence , [SEP] the archipelago is formed by high points on the rim of the calder ##a of a submarine volcano that forms a seam ##ount . the volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same process that formed the floor of the atlantic , and the mid - atlantic ridge . the top of the seam ##ount has gone through periods of complete sub ##mer ##gence , during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms , and during the ice ages the entire calder ##a was above sea level , forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles .
numerous wreck ##s and coral reefs in relatively shallow water [SEP] bermuda ' s pink sand beaches and clear , ce ##ru ##lean blue ocean waters are popular with tourists . many of bermuda ' s hotels are located along the south shore of the island . in addition to its beaches , there are a number of sights ##ee ##ing attractions . historic st george ' s is a designated world heritage site . scuba divers can explore numerous wreck ##s and coral reefs in relatively shallow water ( typically 30 – 40 ft or 9 – 12 m in depth ) , with virtually unlimited visibility . many nearby reefs are readily accessible from shore by s ##nor ##kell ##ers , especially at church bay .

example of a lazarus species [SEP] the only indigenous mammals of bermuda are five species of bats , all of which are also found in the eastern united states : las ##ion ##y ##cter ##is no ##ct ##iva ##gan ##s , las ##iu ##rus bore ##alis , las ##iu ##rus ci ##ner ##eus , las ##iu ##rus semi ##no ##lus and per ##im ##yo ##tis sub ##fl ##av ##us . other commonly known fauna of bermuda include its national bird , the bermuda pet ##rel or ca ##how . it was rediscovered in 1951 after having been thought extinct since the 1620 ##s . it is important as an example of a lazarus species . the government has a programme to protect it , including restoration of a habitat area . the bermuda rock skin ##k was long thought to have been the only indigenous land ve ##rte ##brate of bermuda , discount ##ing the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches . recently through genetic dna studies , scientists have discovered that a species of turtle , the diamond ##back terra ##pin , previously thought to have been introduced , pre - dated the arrival of humans in the archipelago . as this species spends most of its time in bra ##cki ##sh ponds , some question whether it should be classified as a land ve ##rte ##brate to compete with the skin ##k ' s unique status .

obscure ##s their non - african heritage [SEP] the deeper ancestral demo ##graphy of bermuda ' s population has been obscured by the ethnic homo ##gen ##isation of the last four centuries . there is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white be ##rm ##udi ##ans , other than those character ##ising recent immigrant communities . in the 17th century , this was not so . for the first hundred years of settlement , white protestants of english heritage were the distinct majority , with white minorities of irish ( the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been gaelic ) and scots sent to bermuda after the english invasions of their homeland ##s that followed the english civil war . non - white minorities included spanish - speaking , free ( ind ##ent ##ured ) blacks from the west indies , black chat ##tel slaves primarily captured from spanish and portuguese ships by be ##rm ##udi ##an privateer ##s , and native americans , primarily from the al ##gon ##qui ##an and other tribes of the atlantic sea ##board , but possibly from as far away as mexico . by the 19th century , the white ethnic ##ally - english be ##rm ##udi ##ans had lost their numerical advantage . despite the banning of the import ##ation of irish , and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emi ##grate and the owners of black slaves to export them , the merging of the various minority groups , along with some of the white english , had resulted in a new demographic group , " coloured " ( which term , in bermuda , referred to anyone not wholly of european ancestry ) be ##rm ##udi ##ans , gaining a slight majority . any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured stat ##istic . most of those historically described as " coloured " are today described as " black " , or " of african heritage " , which obscure ##s their non - african heritage ( those previously described as " coloured " who were not of african ancestry had been very few , though the numbers of south asian ##s , particularly , is now growing . the number of persons born in asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 census ##es ) , blacks have remained in the majority , with new white immigration from portugal , britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the west indies .
conditions so harsh as to drop their birth rate below the death rate [SEP] bermuda ' s modern black population contains more than one demographic group . although the number of residents born in africa is very small , it has triple ##d between 2000 and 2010 ( this group also includes non - blacks ) . the majority of blacks in bermuda can be termed " be ##rm ##udi ##an blacks " , whose ancestry dates back centuries between the 17th century and the end of slavery in 1834 , bermuda ' s black population was self - sustaining , with its growth resulting largely from natural expansion . this contrasts to the enslaved blacks of the plantation colonies , who were subjected to conditions so harsh as to drop their birth rate below the death rate , and slave ##holders in the united states and the west indies found it necessary to continue import ##ing more enslaved blacks from africa until the end of slavery ( the same had been true for the native americans that the africans had replaced on the new world plantations ) . the indigenous populations of many west indian islands , and much of the south - east of what is now the united states that had survived the 16th - and 17th - century epidemic ##s of european - introduced diseases then became the victims of large - scale slave raiding , with much of the region completely de ##pop ##ulated . when the supply of indigenous slaves ran out , the slave ##holders looked to africa ) . the ancestry of bermuda ' s black population is distinguished from that of the british west indian black population in two ways : firstly , the higher degree of european and native american ad ##mi ##xt ##ure ; secondly , the source of the african ancestry .

the first blacks to arrive in bermuda in any numbers were free blacks from spanish - speaking areas of the west indies [SEP] in the british west indian islands ( and also in the united states ) , the majority of enslaved blacks brought across the atlantic came from west africa ( roughly between modern senegal and ghana ) . very little of bermuda ' s original black emigration came from this area . the first blacks to arrive in bermuda in any numbers were free blacks from spanish - speaking areas of the west indies , and most of the remainder were recently enslaved africans captured from the spanish and portuguese . as spain and portugal sourced most of their slaves from south - west africa ( the portuguese through ports in modern - day angola ; the spanish purchased most of their african slaves from portuguese traders , and from arabs whose slave trading was centred in za ##nz ##ibar ) . genetic studies have consequently shown that the african ancestry of black be ##rm ##udi ##ans ( other than those resulting from recent immigration from the british west indian islands ) is largely from the a band across southern africa , from angola to mozambique , which is similar to what is revealed in latin america , but distinctly different from the blacks of the west indies and the united states .
exiled from the southern new england colonies and sold into slavery [SEP] most of bermuda ' s black population trace some of their ancestry to native americans , although awareness of this is largely limited to st david ' s islanders and most who have such ancestry are unaware of it . during the colonial period , hundreds of native americans were shipped to bermuda . the best - known examples were the al ##gon ##qui ##an peoples who were exiled from the southern new england colonies and sold into slavery in the 17th century , notably in the aftermath ##s of the pe ##qu ##ot and king philip ' s wars .
sea ##far ##ing the only real industry [SEP] because of its limited land area , bermuda has had difficulty with over - population . in the first two centuries of settlement , it relied on steady human emigration to keep the population manage ##able . [ citation needed ] before the american revolution more than ten thousand be ##rm ##udi ##ans ( over half of the total population through the years ) gradually emigrated , primarily to the southern united states . as great britain displaced spain as the dominant european imperial power , it opened up more land for colonial development . a steady trickle of outward migration continued . with sea ##far ##ing the only real industry in the early decades , by the end of the 18th century , at least a third of the island ' s manpower was at sea at any one time .
needed be ##rm ##udi ##ans to farm to generate income from the land [SEP] in the 17th century , the some ##rs isles company suppressed shipbuilding , as it needed be ##rm ##udi ##ans to farm to generate income from the land . agricultural production met with limited success , however . the bermuda cedar boxes used to ship tobacco to england were reportedly worth more than their contents . [ citation needed ] the colony of virginia far surpassed bermuda in both quality and quantity of tobacco produced . be ##rm ##udi ##ans began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century , but the some ##rs isles company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture . this interference led to the islanders demanding , and receiving , the rev ##ocation of the company ' s charter in 168 ##4 , and the company was dissolved .

build ##up of naval and military forces in bermuda , [SEP] the end of the war , however , was to cause profound change in bermuda , though some of those changes would take decades to crystal ##lis ##e . following the war , with the build ##up of naval and military forces in bermuda , the primary leg of the be ##rm ##udi ##an economy became defence infrastructure . even after tourism began later in the 19th century , bermuda remained , in the eyes of london , a base more than a colony . the crown strengthened its political and economic ties to bermuda , and the colony ' s independence on the world stage was diminished .

americans developed their own sources [SEP] the war had removed bermuda ' s primary trading partners , the american colonies , from the empire , and dealt a harsh blow to bermuda ' s merchant shipping trade . this also suffered due to the def ##orestation of bermuda , as well as the advent of metal ships and steam propulsion , for which it did not have raw materials . during the course of the following war of 1812 , the primary market for bermuda ' s salt disappeared as the americans developed their own sources . control of the turks had passed to the bahamas in 1819 .
most famous escape ##e [SEP] the most famous escape ##e was the boer prisoner of war captain fritz jo ##uber ##t du ##ques ##ne who was serving a life sentence for " conspiracy against the british government and on ( the charge of ) espionage . " . on the night of 25 june 1902 , du ##ques ##ne slipped out of his tent , worked his way over a barbed - wire fence , swam 1 . 5 miles ( 2 . 4 km ) past patrol boats and bright spot lights , through storm - wr ##ack ##ed , shark in ##fest ##ed waters , using a distant lighthouse for navigation until he arrived ashore on the main island . from there he escaped to the port of st . george ' s and a week later , he st ##owed away on a boat heading to baltimore , maryland . he settled in the us and later became a spy for germany in both world wars . in 1942 , col . du ##ques ##ne was arrested by the fbi for leading the du ##ques ##ne spy ring , which still to this day the largest espionage case in the history of the united states .
once because of darkness and again to ref ##uel [SEP] after several failed attempts , in 1930 the first aero ##plane reached bermuda . a st ##ins ##on detroit ##er sea ##plane flying from new york , it had to land twice in the ocean : once because of darkness and again to ref ##uel . navigation and weather forecast ##ing improved in 1933 when the royal air force ( then responsible for providing equipment and personnel for the royal navy ' s fleet air arm ) established a station at the royal naval dockyard to repair ( and supply replacement ) float planes for the fleet . in 1936 lu ##ft hans ##a began to experiment with sea ##plane flights from berlin via the azores with continuation to new york city .
the united states is bermuda ' s largest trading partner [SEP] there are few accredited diplomats in bermuda . the united states maintains the largest diplomatic mission in bermuda , comprising both the united states consulate and the us customs and border protection services at the l . f . wade international airport . the current us consul general is robert set ##t ##je , who took office in august 2012 . the united states is bermuda ' s largest trading partner ( providing over 71 % of total imports , 85 % of tourist visitors , and an estimated $ 163 billion of us capital in the bermuda insurance / re - insurance industry ) , and an estimated 5 % of bermuda residents are us citizens , representing 14 % of all foreign - born persons . the american diplomatic presence is an important element in the bermuda political landscape .
primarily to strengthen cultural links . [SEP] this is a socio - economic bloc of nations in or near the caribbean sea . other outlying member states include the co - operative republic of guyana and the republic of suriname in south america , along with belize in central america . the turks and cai ##cos islands , an associate member of car ##ico ##m , and the commonwealth of the bahamas , a full member of car ##ico ##m , are in the atlantic , but near to the caribbean . other nearby nations or territories , such as the united states , are not members ( although the us commonwealth of puerto rico has observer status , and the united states virgin islands announced in 2007 they would seek ties with car ##ico ##m ) . bermuda , at roughly a thousand miles from the caribbean sea , has little trade with , and little economically in common with , the region , and joined primarily to strengthen cultural links .
an extension of virginia [SEP] bermuda was colon ##ised by the english as an extension of virginia and has long had close ties with the us atlantic sea ##board and canadian maritime ##s as well as the uk . it had a history of african slavery , although britain abolished it decades before the us . since the 20th century , there has been considerable immigration to bermuda from the west indies , as well as continued immigration from portuguese atlantic islands . unlike immigrants from british colonies in the west indies , the latter immigrants have had greater difficulty in becoming permanent residents as they lacked british citizenship , mostly spoke no english , and required renewal of work permits to remain beyond an initial period . from the 1950s onwards , bermuda relaxed its immigration laws , allowing increased immigration from britain and canada . some black politicians accused the government of using this device to counter the west indian immigration of previous decades .

many be ##rm ##udi ##ans , both black and white , who lack family connections to the west indies [SEP] the pl ##p , the party in government when the decision to join car ##ico ##m was made , has been dominated for decades by west indians and their descendants . ( the prominent roles of west indians among bermuda ' s black politicians and labour activists pre ##date ##d party politics in bermuda , as exemplified by dr . e . f . gordon ) . the late pl ##p leader , dame lois browne - evans , and her trinidad ##ian - born husband , john evans ( who co - founded the west indian association of bermuda in 1976 ) , were prominent members of this group . they have emphasis ##ed bermuda ' s cultural connections with the west indies . many be ##rm ##udi ##ans , both black and white , who lack family connections to the west indies have objected to this emphasis .
us forces withdrew [SEP] the original nas bermuda on the west side of the island , a sea ##plane base until the mid - 1960s , was designated as the naval air station bermuda annex . it provided optional anchorage and / or dock ##age facilities for transit ##ing us navy , us coast guard and nato vessels , depending on size . an additional us navy compound known as naval facility bermuda ( na ##v ##fa ##c bermuda ) , a so ##sus station , was located to the west of the annex near a canadian forces communications facility . although leased for 99 years , us forces withdrew in 1995 , as part of the wave of base closure ##s following the end of the cold war .
minimal standards of business regulation / laws and direct taxation on personal or corporate income [SEP] bermuda is an offshore financial centre , which results from its minimal standards of business regulation / laws and direct taxation on personal or corporate income . it has one of the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system . bermuda ##s ' s consumption tax is equivalent to local income tax to local residents and funds government and infrastructure expenditures . the local tax system depends upon import duties , payroll taxes and consumption taxes . the legal system is derived from that of the united kingdom , with rec ##ours ##e to english courts of final appeal . foreign private individuals cannot easily open bank accounts or sub ##scribe to mobile phone or internet services .
sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team [SEP] many sports popular today were formal ##ised by british public schools and universities in the 19th century . these schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the british empire , and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team . former public school ##boys continued to pursue these activities , and founded organisations such as the football association ( fa ) . today ' s association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the fa changed its rules to allow professional players .
professionals soon displaced the amateur ex - public school ##boys [SEP] the professionals soon displaced the amateur ex - public school ##boys . bermuda ' s role as the primary royal navy base in the western hemisphere , with an army garrison to match , ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formal ##ised sports to bermuda , including cricket , football , rugby football , and even tennis and rowing ( rowing did not adapt well from british rivers to the stormy atlantic . the officers soon switched to sail racing , founding the royal bermuda yacht club ) . once these sports reached bermuda , they were eagerly adopted by be ##rm ##udi ##ans .
rivalry resulted from the locations [SEP] bermuda ' s national cricket team participated in the cricket world cup 2007 in the west indies . their most famous player is a 130 kilograms ( 290 lb ) police officer named d ##way ##ne lever ##ock . but india defeated bermuda and set a record of 41 ##3 runs in a one - day international ( odi ) . bermuda were knocked out of the world cup . also very well - known is david hem ##p , a former captain of glamorgan in english first class cricket . the annual " cup match " cricket tournament between rival parishes st george ' s in the east and somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday . this tournament began in 1872 when captain more ##sby of the royal navy introduced the game to bermuda , holding a match at somerset to mark forty years since the un ##just th ##ral ##dom of slavery . the east end versus west end rivalry resulted from the locations of the st . george ' s garrison ( the original army headquarters in bermuda ) on barr ##ack hill , st . george ' s , and the royal naval dockyard at ireland island . more ##sby founded the somerset cricket club which plays the st . george ' s cricket club in this game ( the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian ) .
development and harvesting by increased population [SEP] the area near the border with cameroon close to the coast is rich rainforest and part of the cross - san ##aga - bio ##ko coastal forests eco ##region , an important centre for biodiversity . it is habitat for the drill monkey , which is found in the wild only in this area and across the border in cameroon . the areas surrounding cal ##aba ##r , cross river state , also in this forest , are believed to contain the world ' s largest diversity of butterflies . the area of southern nigeria between the niger and the cross rivers has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population , with it being replaced by grassland ( see cross - niger transition forests ) .
little is known about the next period 270 – 650 . [SEP] from the middle of the 3rd century germanic tribes regularly invaded the roman territories . around 275 the romans could no longer maintain the northern border and utrecht was abandoned . little is known about the next period 270 – 650 . utrecht is first spoken of again several centuries after the romans left . under the influence of the growing realms of the franks , during da ##go ##bert i ' s reign in the 7th century , a church was built within the walls of the roman fortress . in ongoing border conflicts with the fr ##isi ##ans this first church was destroyed .
charles v was struggling to ex ##ert his power over the citizens of the city , who had struggled to gain a certain level of independence from the bishops [SEP] the transition from independence to a relatively minor part of a larger union was not easily accepted . to que ##ll uprising ##s charles v was struggling to ex ##ert his power over the citizens of the city , who had struggled to gain a certain level of independence from the bishops and were not willing to ce ##de this to their new lord . the heavily fortified castle vr ##ede ##nburg was built to house a large garrison whose main task was to maintain control over the city . the castle would last less than 50 years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the dutch revolt .
in the early 21st century the whole area is being redeveloped [SEP] the area surrounding utrecht cent ##ra ##al railway station and the station itself were developed following modernist ideas of the 1960s , in a brutal ##ist style . this led to the construction of the shopping mall ho ##og cat ##hari ##jn ##e ( nl ) , music centre vr ##ede ##nburg ( her ##tz ##berger , 1979 ) , and conversion of part of the ancient canal structure into a highway ( cat ##her ##ij ##ne ##ba ##an ) . protest against further modern ##isation of the city centre followed even before the last buildings were final ##ised . in the early 21st century the whole area is being redeveloped . the music redeveloped music centre opened in 2014 where the original vr ##ede ##nburg concert and rock and jazz halls are brought together in a single building .
thematic sunday several organisations create a program , which is open to everyone without , or with a very much reduced , admission fee [SEP] to promote culture utrecht city organizes cultural sundays . during a thematic sunday several organisations create a program , which is open to everyone without , or with a very much reduced , admission fee . there are also initiatives for amateur artists . the city sub ##si ##dis ##es an organisation for amateur education in arts aimed at all inhabitants ( utrecht ##s cent ##rum vo ##or de kunst ##en ) , as does the university for its staff and students . additionally there are also several private initiatives . the city council provides coup ##ons for discount ##s to inhabitants who receive welfare to be used with many of the initiatives .
capitalist en ##ci ##rcle ##ments [SEP] the soviet union , which feared western powers and the possibility of " capitalist en ##ci ##rcle ##ments " , had little faith either that war could be avoided , or faith in the polish army , and wanted nothing less than an iron ##cl ##ad military alliance with france and britain that would provide a guaranteed support for a two - pro ##nged attack on germany ; thus , stalin ' s adherence to the collective security line was purely conditional . britain and france believed that war could still be avoided , and that the soviet union , weakened by the great purge , could not be a main military participant , a point that many military sources were at variance with , especially soviet victories over the japanese kwan ##tung army on the manchu ##rian frontier . france was more anxious to find an agreement with the ussr than was britain ; as a continental power , it was more willing to make concessions , more fearful of the dangers of an agreement between the ussr and germany . these contrasting attitudes partly explain why the ussr has often been charged with playing a double game in 1939 : carrying on open negotiations for an alliance with britain and france while secretly considering proposition ##s from germany .
great purge [SEP] the soviet union , which feared western powers and the possibility of " capitalist en ##ci ##rcle ##ments " , had little faith either that war could be avoided , or faith in the polish army , and wanted nothing less than an iron ##cl ##ad military alliance with france and britain that would provide a guaranteed support for a two - pro ##nged attack on germany ; thus , stalin ' s adherence to the collective security line was purely conditional . britain and france believed that war could still be avoided , and that the soviet union , weakened by the great purge , could not be a main military participant , a point that many military sources were at variance with , especially soviet victories over the japanese kwan ##tung army on the manchu ##rian frontier . france was more anxious to find an agreement with the ussr than was britain ; as a continental power , it was more willing to make concessions , more fearful of the dangers of an agreement between the ussr and germany . these contrasting attitudes partly explain why the ussr has often been charged with playing a double game in 1939 : carrying on open negotiations for an alliance with britain and france while secretly considering proposition ##s from germany .
once the red army entered their territories , it might never leave . [SEP] at the same time , british , french , and soviet ne ##go ##tia ##tors scheduled three - party talks on military matters to occur in moscow in august 1939 , aiming to define what the agreement would specify should be the reaction of the three powers to a german attack . the trip ##art ##ite military talks , started in mid - august , hit a sticking point regarding the passage of soviet troops through poland if germans attacked , and the parties waited as british and french officials overseas pressured polish officials to agree to such terms . polish officials refused to allow soviet troops into polish territory if germany attacked ; as polish foreign minister jozef beck pointed out , they feared that once the red army entered their territories , it might never leave .
leg ##iti ##mi ##zation of soviet annexation of eastern poland [SEP] on 21 september , the soviets and germans signed a formal agreement coordinating military movements in poland , including the " pu ##rg ##ing " of sa ##bot ##eurs . a joint german – soviet parade was held in l ##vo ##v and brest - lit ##ov ##sk , while the countries commanders met in the latter location . stalin had decided in august that he was going to liquid ##ate the polish state , and a german – soviet meeting in september addressed the future structure of the " polish region " . soviet authorities immediately started a campaign of soviet ##ization of the newly acquired areas . the soviets organized staged elections , the result of which was to become a leg ##iti ##mi ##zation of soviet annexation of eastern poland .
to maintain the versailles system . [SEP] when a joint german – soviet peace initiative was rejected by britain and france on 28 september 1939 , soviet foreign policy became critical of the allies and more pro - german in turn . during the fifth session of the supreme soviet on 31 october 1939 mo ##lot ##ov anal ##yse ##d the international situation thus giving the direction for communist propaganda . according to mo ##lot ##ov germany had a legitimate interest in regaining its position as a great power and the allies had started an aggressive war in order to maintain the versailles system .
stalin ' s invasions were a severe ir ##ritan ##t [SEP] the finnish and baltic invasions began a deterioration of relations between the soviets and germany . stalin ' s invasions were a severe ir ##ritan ##t to berlin , as the intent to accomplish these was not communicated to the germans beforehand , and prompted concern that stalin was seeking to form an anti - german bloc . mo ##lot ##ov ' s re ##ass ##urance ##s to the germans , and the germans ' mist ##rus ##t , intensified . on june 16 , as the soviets invaded lithuania , but before they had invaded latvia and estonia , rib ##ben ##tro ##p instructed his staff " to submit a report as soon as possible as to whether in the baltic states a tendency to seek support from the reich can be observed or whether an attempt was made to form a bloc . "

"
reinforce a public affection for germany [SEP] in an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward germany , on 13 april 1941 , the soviets signed a neutrality pact with axis power japan . while stalin had little faith in japan ' s commitment to neutrality , he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism , to reinforce a public affection for germany . stalin felt that there was a growing split in german circles about whether germany should initiate a war with the soviet union . stalin did not know that hitler had been secretly discussing an invasion of the soviet union since summer 1940 , and that hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the east regardless of the parties ' talks of a potential soviet entry as a fourth axis power .
personal insurance for his future well - being [SEP] the german original of the secret protocols was presumably destroyed in the bombing of germany , but in late 1943 , rib ##ben ##tro ##p had ordered that the most secret records of the german foreign office from 1933 on , amount ##ing to some 9 , 800 pages , be micro ##film ##ed . when the various departments of the foreign office in berlin were evacuated to th ##uring ##ia at the end of the war , karl von lo ##es ##ch , a civil servant who had worked for the chief interpreter paul otto schmidt , was entrusted with these micro ##film copies . he eventually received orders to destroy the secret documents but decided to bury the metal container with the micro ##film ##s as a personal insurance for his future well - being . in may 1945 , von lo ##es ##ch approached the british lt . col . robert c . thomson with the request to transmit a personal letter to duncan sandy ##s , churchill ' s son - in - law . in the letter , von lo ##es ##ch revealed that he had knowledge of the documents ' whereabouts but expected prefer ##ential treatment in return . colonel thomson and his american counterpart ralph collins agreed to transfer von lo ##es ##ch to mar ##burg in the american zone if he would produce the micro ##film ##s . the micro ##film ##s contained a copy of the non - aggression treaty as well as the secret protocol . both documents were discovered as part of the micro ##film ##ed records in august 1945 by the state department employee wendell b . blanc ##ke , head of a special unit called " exploitation german archives " ( e ##ga ) .
no current can flow through the cap ##ac ##itor [SEP] when there is a potential difference across the conductors ( e . g . , when a cap ##ac ##itor is attached across a battery ) , an electric field develops across the die ##le ##ctric , causing positive charge + q to collect on one plate and negative charge − ##q to collect on the other plate . if a battery has been attached to a cap ##ac ##itor for a sufficient amount of time , no current can flow through the cap ##ac ##itor . however , if a time - varying voltage is applied across the leads of the cap ##ac ##itor , a displacement current can flow .
to prevent arc ##ing between the foil ##s [SEP] daniel gr ##ala ##th was the first to combine several jars in parallel into a " battery " to increase the charge storage capacity . benjamin franklin investigated the ley ##den jar and came to the conclusion that the charge was stored on the glass , not in the water as others had assumed . he also adopted the term " battery " , ( den ##oting the increasing of power with a row of similar units as in a battery of cannon ) , subsequently applied to clusters of electro ##chemical cells . ley ##den jars were later made by coating the inside and outside of jars with metal foil , leaving a space at the mouth to prevent arc ##ing between the foil ##s . [ citation needed ] the earliest unit of cap ##ac ##itan ##ce was the jar , equivalent to about 1 . 11 nano ##far ##ads .
to complement their newly invented trans ##isto ##r [SEP] charles poll ##ak ( born ka ##rol poll ##ak ) , the inventor of the first electro ##ly ##tic cap ##ac ##itors , found out that the oxide layer on an aluminum an ##ode remained stable in a neutral or al ##kali ##ne electro ##ly ##te , even when the power was switched off . in 1896 he filed a patent for an " electric liquid cap ##ac ##itor with aluminum electrode ##s . " solid electro ##ly ##te tan ##tal ##um cap ##ac ##itors were invented by bell laboratories in the early 1950s as a mini ##at ##urized and more reliable low - voltage support cap ##ac ##itor to complement their newly invented trans ##isto ##r .
temperature dependence [SEP] cap ##ac ##itors devi ##ate from the ideal cap ##ac ##itor equation in a number of ways . some of these , such as leak ##age current and parasitic effects are linear , or can be assumed to be linear , and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the cap ##ac ##itor . the usual methods of network analysis can then be applied . in other cases , such as with breakdown voltage , the effect is non - linear and normal ( i . e . , linear ) network analysis cannot be used , the effect must be dealt with separately . there is yet another group , which may be linear but invalid ##ate the assumption in the analysis that cap ##ac ##itan ##ce is a constant . such an example is temperature dependence . finally , combined parasitic effects such as inherent ind ##uc ##tance , resistance , or die ##le ##ctric losses can exhibit non - uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation .
degradation of the die ##le ##ctric [SEP] the cap ##ac ##itan ##ce of certain cap ##ac ##itors decreases as the component ages . in ceramic cap ##ac ##itors , this is caused by degradation of the die ##le ##ctric . the type of die ##le ##ctric , ambient operating and storage temperatures are the most significant aging factors , while the operating voltage has a smaller effect . the aging process may be reversed by heating the component above the cu ##rie point . aging is fastest near the beginning of life of the component , and the device stabilize ##s over time . electro ##ly ##tic cap ##ac ##itors age as the electro ##ly ##te eva ##por ##ates . in contrast with ceramic cap ##ac ##itors , this occurs towards the end of life of the component .
constant exposure to heat [SEP] leak ##age is equivalent to a resist ##or in parallel with the cap ##ac ##itor . constant exposure to heat can cause die ##le ##ctric breakdown and excessive leak ##age , a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits , particularly where oil ##ed paper and foil cap ##ac ##itors were used . in many vacuum tube circuits , inter ##sta ##ge coupling cap ##ac ##itors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage . a leak ##y cap ##ac ##itor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting , causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube . in power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red , or current limiting resist ##ors to over ##hea ##t , even fail . similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid - state ( trans ##isto ##r ) amplifiers , but owing to lower heat production and the use of modern poly ##ester die ##le ##ctric barriers this once - common problem has become relatively rare .
drops at low temperatures [SEP] electro ##ly ##tic cap ##ac ##itors use an aluminum or tan ##tal ##um plate with an oxide die ##le ##ctric layer . the second electrode is a liquid electro ##ly ##te , connected to the circuit by another foil plate . electro ##ly ##tic cap ##ac ##itors offer very high cap ##ac ##itan ##ce but suffer from poor tolerance ##s , high instability , gradual loss of cap ##ac ##itan ##ce especially when subjected to heat , and high leak ##age current . poor quality cap ##ac ##itors may leak electro ##ly ##te , which is harmful to printed circuit boards . the conduct ##ivity of the electro ##ly ##te drops at low temperatures , which increases equivalent series resistance . while widely used for power - supply conditioning , poor high - frequency characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications . electro ##ly ##tic cap ##ac ##itors will self - de ##grade if unused for a period ( around a year ) , and when full power is applied may short circuit , permanently damaging the cap ##ac ##itor and usually blowing a fuse or causing failure of rec ##ti ##fi ##er di ##odes ( for instance , in older equipment , arc ##ing in rec ##ti ##fi ##er tubes ) . they can be restored before use ( and damage ) by gradually applying the operating voltage , often done on antique vacuum tube equipment over a period of 30 minutes by using a variable transform ##er to supply ac power . unfortunately , the use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment , which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range , requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits . such re ##med ##ies may not be applicable to modern high - frequency power supplies as these produce full output voltage even with reduced input .
even the quantum vacuum is predicted to exhibit non ##ide ##al behavior [SEP] where a single prime denotes the real part and a double prime the imaginary part , z ( ω ) is the complex imp ##edance with the die ##le ##ctric present , cc ##mp ##l ##x ( ω ) is the so - called complex cap ##ac ##itan ##ce with the die ##le ##ctric present , and c ##0 is the cap ##ac ##itan ##ce without the die ##le ##ctric . ( measurement " without the die ##le ##ctric " in principle means measurement in free space , an una ##tta ##ina ##ble goal ina ##sm ##uch as even the quantum vacuum is predicted to exhibit non ##ide ##al behavior , such as di ##ch ##roi ##sm . for practical purposes , when measurement errors are taken into account , often a measurement in terrestrial vacuum , or simply a calculation of c ##0 , is sufficiently accurate . )
to reduce the series resistance and ind ##uc ##tance [SEP] the arrangement of plates and die ##le ##ctric has many variations depending on the desired ratings of the cap ##ac ##itor . for small values of cap ##ac ##itan ##ce ( micro ##far ##ads and less ) , ceramic disks use metallic coating ##s , with wire leads bonded to the coating . larger values can be made by multiple stacks of plates and disks . larger value cap ##ac ##itors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a die ##le ##ctric film to make the plates , and a die ##le ##ctric film of imp ##re ##gna ##ted paper or plastic – these are rolled up to save space . to reduce the series resistance and ind ##uc ##tance for long plates , the plates and die ##le ##ctric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled - up plates , not at the ends of the foil or metal ##ized film strips that comprise the plates .
to provide a " clean " power supply for signal or control circuits [SEP] cap ##ac ##itors are connected in parallel with the power circuits of most electronic devices and larger systems ( such as factories ) to shu ##nt away and conceal current fluctuations from the primary power source to provide a " clean " power supply for signal or control circuits . audio equipment , for example , uses several cap ##ac ##itors in this way , to shu ##nt away power line hum before it gets into the signal circuit ##ry . the cap ##ac ##itors act as a local reserve for the dc power source , and bypass ac currents from the power supply . this is used in car audio applications , when a stiff ##ening cap ##ac ##itor compensate ##s for the ind ##uc ##tance and resistance of the leads to the lead - acid car battery .
the current through the ind ##uc ##tance collapses quickly [SEP] when an ind ##uc ##tive circuit is opened , the current through the ind ##uc ##tance collapses quickly , creating a large voltage across the open circuit of the switch or relay . if the ind ##uc ##tance is large enough , the energy will generate a spark , causing the contact points to ox ##idi ##ze , deter ##ior ##ate , or sometimes we ##ld together , or destroying a solid - state switch . a s ##nu ##bber cap ##ac ##itor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points , thereby preserving their life ; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems , for instance . similarly , in smaller scale circuits , the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still ra ##dia ##te und ##es ##ira ##ble radio frequency interference ( rf ##i ) , which a filter cap ##ac ##itor absorb ##s . s ##nu ##bber cap ##ac ##itors are usually employed with a low - value resist ##or in series , to di ##ssi ##pate energy and minimize rf ##i . such resist ##or - cap ##ac ##itor combinations are available in a single package .

the fall of constantinople in 145 ##3 [SEP] in 134 ##8 , the black death and other disasters sealed a sudden end to the previous period of massive phil ##oso ##phic and scientific development . yet , the red ##is ##co ##very of ancient texts was improved after the fall of constantinople in 145 ##3 , when many byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the west . meanwhile , the introduction of printing was to have great effect on european society . the facilitated dissemination of the printed word democrat ##ized learning and allowed a faster propagation of new ideas . new ideas also helped to influence the development of european science at this point : not least the introduction of algebra . these developments paved the way for the scientific revolution , which may also be understood as a res ##ump ##tion of the process of scientific inquiry , halted at the start of the black death .
po ##sit ##ivism [SEP] the romantic movement of the early 19th century res ##ha ##ped science by opening up new pursuits unexpected in the classical approaches of the enlightenment . major breakthrough ##s came in biology , especially in darwin ' s theory of evolution , as well as physics ( electro ##ma ##gne ##tism ) , mathematics ( non - euclidean geometry , group theory ) and chemistry ( organic chemistry ) . the decline of romantic ##ism occurred because a new movement , po ##sit ##ivism , began to take hold of the ideals of the intellectuals after 1840 and lasted until about 1880 .
individual theorists made important contributions [SEP] geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the scientific revolution , but individual theorists made important contributions . robert hook ##e , for example , formulated a theory of earthquakes , and nicholas ste ##no developed the theory of super ##position and argued that fossils were the remains of once - living creatures . beginning with thomas burn ##et ' s sacred theory of the earth in 168 ##1 , natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the earth had changed over time . burn ##et and his contemporaries interpreted earth ' s past in terms of events described in the bible , but their work laid the intellectual foundations for secular interpretations of earth history .
radio ##metric dating methods were developed [SEP] midway through the 19th century , the focus of geology shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand how the surface of the earth had changed . the first comprehensive theories of mountain building were proposed during this period , as were the first modern theories of earthquakes and volcanoes . louis ag ##ass ##iz and others established the reality of continent - covering ice ages , and " flu ##vial ##ists " like andrew cr ##om ##bie ramsay argued that river valleys were formed , over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them . after the discovery of radio ##act ##ivity , radio ##metric dating methods were developed , starting in the 20th century . alfred we ##gen ##er ' s theory of " continental drift " was widely dismissed when he proposed it in the 1910s , but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory of plate te ##cton ##ics , which provided a plausible mechanism for it . plate te ##cton ##ics also provided a unified explanation for a wide range of seemingly unrelated geological phenomena . since 1970 it has served as the un ##ifying principle in geology .
lower prices [SEP] the above " history of economics " reflects modern economic textbooks and this means that the last stage of a science is represented as the cu ##lm ##ination of its history ( ku ##hn , 1962 ) . the " invisible hand " mentioned in a lost page in the middle of a chapter in the middle of the to " wealth of nations " , 1776 , advances as smith ' s central message . [ cl ##ari ##fication needed ] it is played down that this " invisible hand " acts only " frequently " and that it is " no part of his [ the individual ' s ] intentions " because competition leads to lower prices by im ##itating " his " invention . that this " invisible hand " prefers " the support of domestic to foreign industry " is clean ##sed — often without indication that part of the citation is truncated . the opening passage of the " wealth " containing smith ' s message is never mentioned as it cannot be integrated into modern theory : " wealth " depends on the division of labour which changes with market volume and on the proportion of productive to un ##pro ##ductive labor .
dissolve into infinite ##si ##mal bits of data [SEP] the first dig ##imo ##n anime introduced the dig ##imo ##n life cycle : they age in a similar fashion to real organisms , but do not die under normal circumstances because they are made of rec ##on ##fi ##gur ##able data , which can be seen throughout the show . any dig ##imo ##n that receives a fatal wound will dissolve into infinite ##si ##mal bits of data . the data then rec ##omp ##oses itself as a dig ##i - egg , which will hatch when rubbed gently , and the dig ##imo ##n goes through its life cycle again . dig ##imo ##n who are rein ##car ##nated in this way will sometimes retain some or all their memories of their previous life . however , if a dig ##imo ##n ' s data is completely destroyed , they will die .
goes through its life cycle again [SEP] the first dig ##imo ##n anime introduced the dig ##imo ##n life cycle : they age in a similar fashion to real organisms , but do not die under normal circumstances because they are made of rec ##on ##fi ##gur ##able data , which can be seen throughout the show . any dig ##imo ##n that receives a fatal wound will dissolve into infinite ##si ##mal bits of data . the data then rec ##omp ##oses itself as a dig ##i - egg , which will hatch when rubbed gently , and the dig ##imo ##n goes through its life cycle again . dig ##imo ##n who are rein ##car ##nated in this way will sometimes retain some or all their memories of their previous life . however , if a dig ##imo ##n ' s data is completely destroyed , they will die .
they will die [SEP] the first dig ##imo ##n anime introduced the dig ##imo ##n life cycle : they age in a similar fashion to real organisms , but do not die under normal circumstances because they are made of rec ##on ##fi ##gur ##able data , which can be seen throughout the show . any dig ##imo ##n that receives a fatal wound will dissolve into infinite ##si ##mal bits of data . the data then rec ##omp ##oses itself as a dig ##i - egg , which will hatch when rubbed gently , and the dig ##imo ##n goes through its life cycle again . dig ##imo ##n who are rein ##car ##nated in this way will sometimes retain some or all their memories of their previous life . however , if a dig ##imo ##n ' s data is completely destroyed , they will die .
the dig ##imo ##n change appearance and become much stronger , often changing in personality as well [SEP] " dig ##imo ##n " are " digital monsters " . according to the stories , they are inhabitants of the " dig ##i ##world " , a manifestation of earth ' s communication network . the stories tell of a group of mostly pre - teens , who accompany special dig ##imo ##n born to defend their world ( and ours ) from various evil forces . to help them sur ##mount the most difficult obstacles found within both realms , the dig ##imo ##n have the ability to evolve ( dig ##ivo ##l ##ve ) in this process , the dig ##imo ##n change appearance and become much stronger , often changing in personality as well . the group of children who come in contact with the digital world changes from series to series .
the mega level [SEP] the series is set three years after the events of dig ##imo ##n adventure 02 , when dig ##imo ##n who turn rogue by a mysterious infection appear to wr ##eak havoc in the human world . tai and the other dig ##ides ##tine ##d from the original series reunite with their partners and start fighting back with support from the japanese government , while davis , yo ##lei , cody and ken are defeated by a powerful enemy called alpha ##mon and disappear without a trace . tai and the others also meet another dig ##ides ##tine ##d called mei ##ko mo ##chi ##zuki and her partner mei ##co ##omo ##n who become their friends , until mei ##co ##omo ##n turns hostile as well and flees after an encounter with ken , who re ##app ##ears suddenly , once again as the dig ##imo ##n emperor . the film series also feature several dig ##ides ##tine ##d having their partners dig ##ivo ##l ##ve up to the mega level for the first time , a feat only tai and matt had achieved previously .
both magazines were cancelled [SEP] the european publishing company , pan ##ini , approached dig ##imo ##n in different ways in different countries . while germany created their own adaptations of episodes , the united kingdom ( uk ) reprinted the dark horse titles , then translated some of the german adaptations of adventure 02 episodes . eventually the uk comics were given their own original stories , which appeared in both the uk ' s official dig ##imo ##n magazine and the official uk fox kids companion magazine , wi ##cki ##d . these original stories only roughly followed the continuity of adventure 02 . when the comic switched to the tame ##rs series the storylines adhere ##d to continuity more strictly ; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original japanese anime ( such as mit ##su ##o ya ##ma ##ki ' s past ) or the english adaptations of the television shows and movies ( such as ry ##o ' s story or the movies that remained und ##ub ##bed until 2005 ) . in a money saving venture , the original stories were later removed from dig ##imo ##n magazine , which returned to printing translated german adaptations of tame ##rs episodes . eventually , both magazines were cancelled .
stresses induced by their weight [SEP] a glacier ( us / ˈ ##ɡ ##le ##ɪ ##ʃ ##ə ##r / or uk / ˈ ##ɡ ##l ##æ ##si ##ə / ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight ; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ab ##lation ( melting and sub ##lim ##ation ) over many years , often centuries . glaciers slowly def ##or ##m and flow due to stresses induced by their weight , creating cr ##eva ##sse ##s , sera ##cs , and other distinguishing features . they also ab ##rade rock and debris from their substrate to create land ##forms such as ci ##r ##ques and mora ##ines . glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water .
warmer summer temperatures [SEP] glacial ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on earth . many glaciers from temperate , alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of melt ##water as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt , creating a water source that is especially important for plants , animals and human uses when other sources may be scan ##t . within high altitude and antarctic environments , the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release melt ##water .
they are under low pressure [SEP] the top 50 m ( 160 ft ) of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure . this upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastic ##ally flowing lower section . when a glacier moves through irregular terrain , cracks called cr ##eva ##sse ##s develop in the fracture zone . cr ##eva ##sse ##s form due to differences in glacier velocity . if two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions , shear forces cause them to break apart , opening a cr ##eva ##sse . cr ##eva ##sse ##s are seldom more than 46 m ( 150 ft ) deep but in some cases can be 300 m ( 1 , 000 ft ) or even deeper . beneath this point , the plastic ##ity of the ice is too great for cracks to form . intersecting cr ##eva ##sse ##s can create isolated peaks in the ice , called sera ##cs .
differences in glacier velocity [SEP] the top 50 m ( 160 ft ) of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure . this upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastic ##ally flowing lower section . when a glacier moves through irregular terrain , cracks called cr ##eva ##sse ##s develop in the fracture zone . cr ##eva ##sse ##s form due to differences in glacier velocity . if two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions , shear forces cause them to break apart , opening a cr ##eva ##sse . cr ##eva ##sse ##s are seldom more than 46 m ( 150 ft ) deep but in some cases can be 300 m ( 1 , 000 ft ) or even deeper . beneath this point , the plastic ##ity of the ice is too great for cracks to form . intersecting cr ##eva ##sse ##s can create isolated peaks in the ice , called sera ##cs .
reduction in speed caused by friction of the valley walls [SEP] cr ##eva ##sse ##s can form in several different ways . transverse cr ##eva ##sse ##s are transverse to flow and form where steep ##er slopes cause a glacier to accelerate . longitudinal cr ##eva ##sse ##s form semi - parallel to flow where a glacier expands lateral ##ly . marginal cr ##eva ##sse ##s form from the edge of the glacier , due to the reduction in speed caused by friction of the valley walls . marginal cr ##eva ##sse ##s are usually largely transverse to flow . moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from st ##ag ##nant ice above , forming a berg ##sch ##run ##d . berg ##sch ##run ##ds resemble cr ##eva ##sse ##s but are singular features at a glacier ' s margins .
trees can establish themselves on surface sediment deposits [SEP] mean speeds vary greatly , but is typically around 1 m ( 3 ft ) per day . there may be no motion in st ##ag ##nant areas ; for example , in parts of alaska , trees can establish themselves on surface sediment deposits . in other cases , glaciers can move as fast as 20 – 30 m ( 70 – 100 ft ) per day , such as in greenland ' s jakob ##sha ##vn is ##br ##æ ( greenland ##ic : ser ##me ##q ku ##jal ##le ##q ) . velocity increases with increasing slope , increasing thickness , increasing snowfall , increasing longitudinal confinement , increasing basal temperature , increasing melt ##water production and reduced bed hardness .
precipitation is higher [SEP] the permanent snow cover necessary for glacier formation is affected by factors such as the degree of slope on the land , amount of snowfall and the winds . glaciers can be found in all latitude ##s except from 20 ##° to 27 ##° north and south of the equator where the presence of the descending limb of the hadley circulation lowers precipitation so much that with high ins ##ola ##tion snow lines reach above 6 , 500 m ( 21 , 330 ft ) . between [UNK] and [UNK] , however , precipitation is higher and the mountains above 5 , 000 m ( 16 , 400 ft ) usually have permanent snow .
increase in high - speed internet customers [SEP] the book value of the company nearly doubled from $ 8 . 19 a share in 1999 to $ 15 a share in 2009 . revenues grew six ##fold from 1999 ' s $ 6 billion to almost $ 36 billion in 2009 . net profit margin rose from 4 . 2 % in 1999 to 8 . 4 % in 2009 , with operating margins improving 31 percent and return on equity doubling to 6 . 7 percent in the same time span . between 1999 and 2009 , return on capital nearly triple ##d to 7 percent . com ##cast reported first quarter 2012 profit increases of 30 % due to increase in high - speed internet customers . in february 2014 , com ##cast generated 1 . 1 billion in revenue during the first quarter due to the soc ##hi olympics , .
the u . s . olympic committee and com ##cast have ended the plans [SEP] com ##cast delivers third - party television programming content to its own customers , and also produces its own first - party content both for subscribers and customers of other competing television services . fully or partially owned com ##cast programming includes com ##cast news ##makers , com ##cast network , com ##cast sports ##net , sports ##net new york , mlb network , com ##cast sports southeast / charter sports southeast , nbc sports network , the golf channel , az ##n television , and fear ##net . on may 19 , 2009 , disney and espn announced an agreement to allow com ##cast corporation to carry the channels espn ##u and espn ##3 . the u . s . olympic committee and com ##cast intended to team up to create the u . s . olympic network , which was slated to launch after the 2010 vancouver olympic games . these plans were then put on hold by the u . s . olympic committee . the u . s . olympic committee and com ##cast have ended the plans to create the u . s . olympic network .
to take advantage of group preference policies [SEP] in 1976 , a group of italian american professors at city university of new york asked to be added as an affirmative action category for promotion and hiring . italian americans are usually considered white in the us and would not be covered under affirmative action policies , but the professors believed they were under ##re ##pres ##ented . libertarian economist thomas so ##well wrote in his book , affirmative action around the world : an empirical study , that affirmative action policies encourage non - preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [ i . e . , primary ben ##ef ##icia ##ries of affirmative action ] to take advantage of group preference policies .
because doing so is unnecessary [SEP] terry east ##land , the author who wrote from ending affirmative action : the case for color ##bl ##ind justice states , " most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories : remedy ##ing past discrimination and promoting diversity " . east ##land believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anti ##ci ##pate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it , mostly middle class minorities . additionally , she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self - doubt and en ##ti ##tlement in minorities . east ##land believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off , and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another . libertarian economist thomas so ##well identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book , affirmative action around the world : an empirical study . so ##well writes that affirmative action policies encourage non - preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [ i . e . , primary ben ##ef ##icia ##ries of affirmative action ] to take advantage of group preference policies ; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group ( e . g . , upper and middle class blacks ) , often to the det ##rim ##ent of the least fortunate among the non - preferred groups ( e . g . , poor white or asian ) ; that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non - preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole ; and that they eng ##end ##er an ##imo ##sity toward preferred groups as well . : 115 – 147
the students for fair admissions lawsuit makes similar allegations [SEP] in may 2015 , a coalition of more than 60 asian - american organizations filed federal complaints with the education and justice departments against harvard university . the coalition asked for a civil rights investigation into what they described as harvard ' s disc ##rim ##inatory admission practices against asian - american applicants . the complaint asserts that recent studies indicate that harvard has engaged in systematic and continuous discrimination against asian americans in its " ho ##listic " admissions process . asian - american applicants with near - perfect test scores , top - one - percent grade point averages , academic awards , and leadership positions are allegedly rejected by harvard because the university uses racial stereotypes , racial ##ly differentiated standards , and de facto racial quota ##s . this federal complaint was dismissed in july 2015 because the students for fair admissions lawsuit makes similar allegations .
the club claimed that they did not want to dev ##al ##ue the fa cup by fielding a weaker side . [SEP] it is very rare for top clubs to miss the competition , although it can happen in exceptional circumstances . defending holders manchester united did not enter the 1999 – 2000 fa cup , as they were already in the inaugural club world championship , with the club stating that entering both tournaments would over ##load their fixture schedule and make it more difficult to defend their champions league and premiership titles . the club claimed that they did not want to dev ##al ##ue the fa cup by fielding a weaker side . the move benefited united as they received a two - week break and won the 1999 – 2000 league title by an 18 - point margin , although they did not progress past the group stage of the club world championship . the withdrawal from the fa cup , however , drew considerable criticism as this weakened the tournament ' s prestige and sir alex ferguson later admitted his regret regarding their handling of the situation .
fixtures ending in a tie are replay ##ed once only [SEP] beginning in august , the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout , consisting of twelve rounds , a semi - final and then a final , in may . a system of bye ##s ensures clubs above level 9 and 10 enter the competition at later stages . there is no seed ##ing , the fixtures in each round being determined by a random draw . prior to the semi - finals , fixtures ending in a tie are replay ##ed once only . the first six rounds are qualifiers , with the draws organised on a regional basis . the next six rounds are the " proper " rounds where all clubs are in one draw .
most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an experiment [SEP] the final is normally held the saturday after the premier league season finishes in may . the only seasons in recent times when this pattern was not followed were 1999 – 2000 , when most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an experiment , and 2010 – 11 and 2012 – 13 when the fa cup final was played before the premier league season had finished , to allow wembley stadium to be ready for the uefa champions league final , as well as in 2011 – 12 to allow england time to prepare for that summer ' s european championships .
the fa cup final was played before the premier league season had finished , to allow wembley stadium to be ready for the uefa champions league final [SEP] the final is normally held the saturday after the premier league season finishes in may . the only seasons in recent times when this pattern was not followed were 1999 – 2000 , when most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an experiment , and 2010 – 11 and 2012 – 13 when the fa cup final was played before the premier league season had finished , to allow wembley stadium to be ready for the uefa champions league final , as well as in 2011 – 12 to allow england time to prepare for that summer ' s european championships .
to rec ##ou ##p debts in financing the new stadium . [SEP] in 2003 the fa took the decision to permanently use the new wembley for semi - finals to rec ##ou ##p debts in financing the new stadium . this was controversial , with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far from london , as well as taking some of the prestige away from a wembley final . in defending the move , the fa has also cited the extra capacity wembley offers , although the 2013 fixture between mill ##wall and wigan led to the unprecedented step of placing 6 , 000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out . a fan poll by the guardian in 2013 found 86 % opposition to wembley semi - finals .
they had to switch their tie to the ground of another eligible en ##tra ##nt with a natural grass pitch . [SEP] the fa permitted artificial turf ( 3 ##g ) pitches in all rounds of the competition from the 2014 – 15 edition and beyond . under the 2015 - 16 rules , the pitch must be of fifa one star quality , or two star for ties if they involve one of the 92 professional clubs . this followed approval two years previously for their use in the qualifying rounds only - if a team with a 3 ##g pitch progressed to the competition proper , they had to switch their tie to the ground of another eligible en ##tra ##nt with a natural grass pitch . having been strong proponents of the surface , the first match in the proper rounds to be played on a 3 ##g surface was a televised first round replay at maids ##tone united ' s gallagher stadium on 20 november 2015 .
the trophy was to be permanently presented to any club which won the competition three times , [SEP] the tradition of presenting the trophy immediately after the game did not start until the 1882 final ; after the first final in 1872 the trophy was not presented to the winners , wanderers , until a reception held four weeks later in the pal ##l mall restaurant in london . under the original rules , the trophy was to be permanently presented to any club which won the competition three times , although when inaugural winners wanderers achieved this feat by the 1876 final , the rules were changed by fa secretary cw al ##cock ( who was also captain of wanderers in their first victory ) .
harsh winters , bad harvest ##s , and the black death [SEP] as in much of europe , the prosperity of alsace came to an end in the 14th century by a series of harsh winters , bad harvest ##s , and the black death . these hardship ##s were blamed on jews , leading to the po ##gr ##oms of 133 ##6 and 133 ##9 . in 134 ##9 , jews of alsace were accused of poisoning the wells with plague , leading to the massacre of thousands of jews during the strasbourg po ##gr ##om . jews were subsequently forbidden to settle in the town . an additional natural disaster was the rhine rift earthquake of 135 ##6 , one of europe ' s worst which made ruins of basel . prosperity returned to alsace under habsburg administration during the renaissance .
to gain back full control of upper alsace [SEP] in 146 ##9 , following the treaty of st . om ##er , upper alsace was sold by archduke sigismund of austria to charles the bold , duke of burgundy . although charles was the nominal landlord , taxes were paid to frederick iii , holy roman emperor . the latter was able to use this tax and a d ##yna ##stic marriage to his advantage to gain back full control of upper alsace ( apart from the free towns , but including bel ##fort ) in 147 ##7 when it became part of the dem ##es ##ne of the habsburg family , who were also rulers of the empire . the town of mu ##lho ##use joined the swiss confederation in 151 ##5 , where it was to remain until 1798 .
food shortage at the end of the winter [SEP] traditionally a carnival feast was the last opportunity to eat well before the time of food shortage at the end of the winter during which one was limited to the minimum necessary . on what nowadays is called vast ##ena ##von ##d ( the days before fast ##ing ) all the remaining winter stores of la ##rd , butter and meat which were left would be eaten , for it would soon start to rot and decay . the selected livestock had in fact already been slaughtered in november and the meat would be no longer pre ##ser ##vable . all the food that had survived the winter had to be eaten to assure that everyone was fed enough to survive until the coming spring would provide new food sources .

to make sure that fertility could return in spring [SEP] several germanic tribes celebrated the returning of the daylight . a predominant deity was during this jubilee driven around in a noisy procession on a ship on wheels . the winter would be driven out , to make sure that fertility could return in spring . a central figure was possibly the fertility goddess ne ##rth ##us . also there are some indications that the e ##ffi ##gy of ne ##rth ##us or frey ##r was placed on a ship with wheels and accompanied by a procession of people in animal disguise and men in women ' s clothes . aboard the ship would the marriage of a man and woman be con ##sum ##mate ##d as a fertility ritual .
outlet for their daily frustration ##s [SEP] while christian festivals such as corpus christi were church - sanctioned celebrations , carnival was also a manifestation of european folk culture . in the christian tradition the fast ##ing is to commemorate the 40 days that jesus fast ##ed in the desert according to the new testament and also to reflect on christian values . as with many other christian festivals such as christmas which was originally a pagan mid ##win ##ter festival , the christian church has found it easier to turn the pagan car ##na ##val in a catholic tradition than to eliminate it . unlike today , carnival in the middle ages took not just a few days , but it covered almost the entire period between christmas and the beginning of lent . in those two months , several catholic holidays were seized by the catholic population as an outlet for their daily frustration ##s .
horribly murdered [SEP] while forming an integral part of the christian calendar , particularly in catholic regions , many carnival traditions resemble those ant ##eda ##ting christianity . italian carnival is sometimes thought to be derived from the ancient roman festivals of saturn ##alia and ba ##cc ##hana ##lia . the saturn ##alia , in turn , may be based on the greek dion ##ys ##ia and oriental festivals . for the start of the roman saturn ##alia , on december 17 authorities chose an enemy of the roman people to represent the lord of mis ##ru ##le in each community . these men and women were forced to ind ##ul ##ge in food and physical pleasures throughout the week , horribly murdered on december 25th : " destroying the forces of darkness " .
in the interest of the sexual health [SEP] a uniquely creole tradition is the to ##ulo ##ulous . these women wear decorative gown ##s , gloves , masks and head ##dre ##sse ##s that cover them completely , making them un ##re ##co ##gni ##sable , even to the colour of their skin . on friday and saturday nights of carnival , to ##ulo ##ulo ##u balls are held in so - called universities ; in reality , large dance halls that open only at carnival time . to ##ulo ##ulous get in free , and are even given condoms in the interest of the sexual health of the community . men attend the balls , but they pay admit ##tance and are not disguised . the to ##ulo ##ulous pick their dance partners , who may not refuse . the setup is designed to make it easy for a woman to create a temporary liaison with a man in total an ##ony ##mity . und ##is ##gui ##sed women are not welcomed . by tradition , if such a woman gets up to dance , the orchestra stops playing . alcohol is served at bars – the disguised women whisper to the men " to ##ulo ##ulo ##u thirsty " , at which a round of drinks is expected , to be drunk through a straw protect their an ##ony ##mity .

because it is the rainy season [SEP] peruvian carnival incorporates elements of violence and reflects the urban violence in peruvian society following the internal conflict in peru . traditionally , peruvian and ##ean festivities were held on this period every year because it is the rainy season . it was already violent during the 19th century , but the government limited the practice . during the early 20th century it consisted party ##ing and para ##ding , while in the second half of the 20th century it acquired violent characteristics that continued . it was banned , first from the streets in 1958 and altogether in 1959 by the pr ##ado government . it consisted basically of water battles in a traditional way , [ cl ##ari ##fication needed ] while in later years it included playing with dirty water , mud , oil and color ##ants - and also including fighting and sometimes looting private property and sexual assaults on women . it has become an excuse for criminal gangs to rob people while pretending to celebrate . as of 2010 , it had become so violent that the government imposed penalties of up to eight years in prison for violence during the games ( the games themselves are not forbidden , but using violence during the games or coe ##rc ##ing others to participate is ) .
over slavery and missions [SEP] in may 1845 , the baptist congregations in the united states split over slavery and missions . the home mission society prevented slave ##holders from being appointed as missionaries . the split created the southern baptist convention , while the northern congregations formed their own umbrella organization now called the american baptist churches usa ( abc - usa ) . the methodist episcopal church , south had recently separated over the issue of slavery , and southern presbyterian ##s would do so shortly thereafter .
because it allowed them to generate income while taking care of household duties . [SEP] factories and mines were not the only places where child labour was prevalent in the early 20th century . home - based manufacturing across the united states and europe employed children as well . governments and reformer ##s argued that labour in factories must be regulated and the state had an obligation to provide welfare for poor . legislation that followed had the effect of moving work out of factories into urban homes . families and women , in particular , preferred it because it allowed them to generate income while taking care of household duties .
they were first helping to provide for their families ; while also transition ##ing to save for their own future families [SEP] many factors played a role in britain ’ s long - term economic growth , such as the industrial revolution in the late 1700 ##s and the prominent presence of child labour during the industrial age . children who worked at an early age were often not forced ; but did so because they needed to help their family survive financially . due to poor employment opportunities for many parents , sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family . child labour first started to occur in england when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass - produced the once homemade goods . because children often helped produce the goods out of their homes , working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths . although there are many counts of children under the age of ten working for factories , the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen . this age range was an important time for many youths as they were first helping to provide for their families ; while also transition ##ing to save for their own future families .
increasing need of cheap labour [SEP] on 23 june 1757 , the english east india company defeated sir ##aj - ud - da ##ula , the nawab of bengal , in the battle of pl ##asse ##y . the british thus became masters of east india ( bengal , bihar , or ##issa ) – a prosperous region with a flourishing agriculture , industry and trade . this led to a large amount of children being forced into labour due to the increasing need of cheap labour to produce large numbers of goods . many multinational ##s often employed children because that they can be recruited for less pay , and have more endurance to ut ##ilis ##e in factory environments . another reason many indian children were hired was because they lack knowledge of their basic rights , they did not cause trouble or complain , and they were often more trust ##worthy . the innocence that comes with childhood was ut ##ilised to make a profit by many and was encouraged by the need for family income .
children were handed over to the farmer asking the least amount of money [SEP] there were even verdi ##ng ##kind ##er auction ##s where children were handed over to the farmer asking the least amount of money from the authorities , thus securing cheap labour for his farm and re ##lie ##ving the authority from the financial burden of looking after the children . in the 1930s 20 % of all agricultural labourers in the canton of bern were children below the age of 15 . swiss municipality guardians ##hip authorities acted so , commonly tolerated by federal authorities , to the 1960s , not all of them of course , but usually communities affected of low taxes in some swiss canton ##s swiss historian marco le ##uen ##berger investigated , that in 1930 there were some 35 , 000 ind ##ent ##ured children , and between 1920 and 1970 more than 100 , 000 are believed to have been placed with families or homes . 10 , 000 verdi ##ng ##kind ##er are still alive . therefore , the so - called wi ##ede ##rg ##ut ##mac ##hun ##gs ##ini ##tia ##tive was started in april 2014 . in april 2014 the collection of targeted at least authentic ##ated 100 , 000 signatures of swiss citizens has started , and still have to be collected to october 2015 .
agreed to a number of exceptions for young people in its child labour laws [SEP] similarly , in 1996 , member countries of the european union , per directive 94 / 33 / ec , agreed to a number of exceptions for young people in its child labour laws . under these rules , children of various ages may work in cultural , artistic , sporting or advertising activities if authorised by the competent authority . children above the age of 13 may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country . additionally , the european law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work / training scheme . the eu directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances . nonetheless , many children under the age of 13 do work , even in the most developed countries of the eu . for instance , a recent study showed over a third of dutch twelve - year - old kids had a job , the most common being baby ##sit ##ting .
de ##press ##es the wages of adults in developing countries as well as the developed countries [SEP] some scholars [ who ? ] suggest any labour by children aged 18 years or less is wrong since this encourages ill ##iter ##acy , inhuman ##e work and lower investment in human capital . child labour , claim these activists , also leads to poor labour standards for adults , de ##press ##es the wages of adults in developing countries as well as the developed countries , and doom ##s the third world economies to low - skill jobs only capable of producing poor quality cheap exports . more children that work in poor countries , the fewer and worse - paid are the jobs for adults in these countries . in other words , there are moral and economic reasons that justify a blanket ban on labour from children aged 18 years or less , everywhere in the world .
economic development [SEP] these scholars suggest , from their studies of economic and social data , that early 20th - century child labour in europe and the united states ended in large part as a result of the economic development of the formal regulated economy , technology development and general prosperity . child labour laws and il ##o conventions came later . edmond ##s suggests , even in contemporary times , the incidence of child labour in vietnam has rapidly reduced following economic reforms and gdp growth . these scholars suggest economic engagement , emphasis on opening quality schools rather than more laws and expanding economically relevant skill development opportunities in the third world . international legal actions , such as trade sanctions increase child labour .
economic reforms [SEP] these scholars suggest , from their studies of economic and social data , that early 20th - century child labour in europe and the united states ended in large part as a result of the economic development of the formal regulated economy , technology development and general prosperity . child labour laws and il ##o conventions came later . edmond ##s suggests , even in contemporary times , the incidence of child labour in vietnam has rapidly reduced following economic reforms and gdp growth . these scholars suggest economic engagement , emphasis on opening quality schools rather than more laws and expanding economically relevant skill development opportunities in the third world . international legal actions , such as trade sanctions increase child labour .
have not yet been met [SEP] in 2001 , a voluntary agreement called the ha ##rkin - eng ##el protocol , was accepted by the international cocoa and chocolate industry to eliminate the worst forms of child labour , as defined by il ##o ' s convention 182 , in west africa . this agreement created a foundation named international cocoa initiative in 2002 . the foundation claims it has , as of 2011 , active programs in 290 cocoa growing communities in cote d ' ivo ##ire and ghana , reaching a total population of 68 ##9 , 000 people to help eliminate the worst forms of child labour in cocoa industry . other organisations claim progress has been made , but the protocol ' s 2005 deadline ##s have not yet been met .
it is the second largest earn ##er of its export revenue [SEP] small - scale art ##isan ##al mining of gold is another source of dangerous child labour in poor rural areas in certain parts of the world . this form of mining uses labour - intensive and low - tech methods . it is informal sector of the economy . human rights watch group estimates that about 12 percent of global gold production comes from art ##isan ##al mines . in west africa , in countries such as mali - the third largest export ##er of gold in africa - between 20 , 000 and 40 , 000 children work in art ##isan ##al mining . locally known as or ##pa ##illa ##ge , children as young as 6 years old work with their families . these children and families suffer chronic exposure to toxic chemicals including mercury , and do hazardous work such as digging shafts and working underground , pulling up , carrying and crushing the ore . the poor work practices harm the long term health of children , as well as release hundreds of tons of mercury every year into local rivers , ground water and lakes . gold is important to the economy of mali and ghana . for mali , it is the second largest earn ##er of its export revenue . for many poor families with children , it is the primary and sometimes the only source of income .
returned the television award [SEP] prima ##rk continued to investigate the allegations for three years , concluding that bbc report was a fake . in 2011 , following an investigation by the bbc trust ’ s editorial standards committee , the bbc announced , " having carefully sc ##rut ##ini ##sed all of the relevant evidence , the committee concluded that , on the balance of pro ##ba ##bilities , it was more likely than not that the bangalore footage was not authentic . " bbc subsequently ap ##olo ##gis ##ed for fa ##king footage , and returned the television award for investigative reporting .
stone - crushing , street hu ##st ##ling , and prostitution " [SEP] concerns have often been raised over the buying public ' s moral com ##plicity in purchasing products assembled or otherwise manufactured in developing countries with child labour . however , others have raised concerns that boycott ##ing products manufactured through child labour may force these children to turn to more dangerous or st ##ren ##uous professions , such as prostitution or agriculture . for example , a unicef study found that after the child labour deter ##rence act was introduced in the us , an estimated 50 , 000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in bangladesh , leaving many to resort to jobs such as " stone - crushing , street hu ##st ##ling , and prostitution " , jobs that are " more hazardous and exploit ##ative than garment production " . the study suggests that boycott ##s are " blunt instruments with long - term consequences , that can actually harm rather than help the children involved . "
rose [SEP] besides slaves , there were a number of free people of color in the state . most were descended from free african americans who had migrated along with neighbors from virginia during the 18th century . the majority were the descendants of unions in the working classes between white women , ind ##ent ##ured servants or free , and african men , ind ##ent ##ured , slave or free . after the revolution , quakers and men ##non ##ites worked to persuade slave ##holders to free their slaves . some were inspired by their efforts and the language of the revolution to arrange for man ##umi ##ssion of their slaves . the number of free people of color rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the revolution .
the fuji ##wara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces [SEP] the fuji ##wara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces , which left robbers free to prey on travelers . this is implicit ##ly illustrated in novels by the terror that night travel inspired in the main characters . the shoe ##n system enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite ; the economic surplus can be linked to the cultural developments of the he ##ian period and the " pursuit of arts " . the major buddhist temples in he ##ian - ky ##o and nara also made use of the shoe ##n . the establishment of branches rural ##ly and integration of some shin ##to shrines within these temple networks reflects a greater " organizational d ##yna ##mism " .
their relatives on the island seemed " miserable , degraded savage ##s " [SEP] in december 1831 , he joined the bea ##gle expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist . he read charles l ##ye ##ll ' s principles of geology and from the first stop ashore , at st . ja ##go , found l ##ye ##ll ' s uniform ##itarian ##ism a key to the geological history of landscapes . darwin discovered fossils resembling huge arm ##adi ##llo ##s , and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their " centre of creation " . the three fu ##eg ##ian missionaries the expedition returned to tier ##ra del fu ##ego were friendly and civil ##ised , yet to darwin their relatives on the island seemed " miserable , degraded savage ##s " , and he no longer saw an un ##bridge ##able gap between humans and animals . as the bea ##gle neared england in 1836 , he noted that species might not be fixed .
numerous ex ##pl ##ana ##tory notes giving her own answers to doubts that darwin expressed [SEP] the book was widely translated in darwin ' s lifetime , but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphor ##s , and some translations were biased by the translator ' s own agenda . darwin distributed presentation copies in france and germany , hoping that suitable applicants would come forward , as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher . he welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist heinrich georg bro ##nn , but the german translation published in 1860 imposed bro ##nn ' s own ideas , adding controversial themes that darwin had deliberately omitted . bro ##nn translated " favoured races " as " perfect ##ed races " , and added essays on issues including the origin of life , as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by bro ##nn ' s adherence to nat ##ur ##phi ##los ##op ##hi ##e . in 1862 , bro ##nn produced a second edition based on the third english edition and darwin ' s suggested additions , but then died of a heart attack . darwin corresponded closely with julius victor car ##us , who published an improved translation in 1867 . darwin ' s attempts to find a translator in france fell through , and the translation by cl ##eme ##nce roy ##er published in 1862 added an introduction praising darwin ' s ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social darwin ##ism and eugen ##ics , as well as numerous ex ##pl ##ana ##tory notes giving her own answers to doubts that darwin expressed . darwin corresponded with roy ##er about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870 , but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions . he remained un ##sat ##is ##fied until a translation by edmond barbie ##r was published in 1876 . a dutch translation by tiberius corn ##elis winkler was published in 1860 . by 1864 , additional translations had appeared in italian and russian . in darwin ' s lifetime , origin was published in swedish in 1871 , danish in 1872 , polish in 1873 , hungarian in 1873 – 1874 , spanish in 1877 and serbian in 1878 . by 1977 , it had appeared in an additional 18 languages .

[SEP] he notes that both a . p . de can ##do ##lle and charles l ##ye ##ll had stated that all organisms are exposed to severe competition . darwin emphasizes that he used the phrase " struggle for existence " in " a large and metaphor ##ical sense , including dependence of one being on another " ; he gives examples ranging from plants struggling against drought to plants competing for birds to eat their fruit and di ##sse ##minate their seeds . he describes the struggle resulting from population growth : " it is the doctrine of mal ##thus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms . " he discusses checks to such increase including complex ecological inter ##de ##pen ##den ##cies , and notes that competition is most severe between closely related forms " which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature " .
why , if species have descended from other species by ins ##ens ##ibly fine gr ##ada ##tions , do we not everywhere see inn ##ume ##rable transitional forms ? [SEP] chapter vi begins by saying the next three chapters will address possible objections to the theory , the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found , though the theory implies such forms must have existed . as darwin noted , " firstly , why , if species have descended from other species by ins ##ens ##ibly fine gr ##ada ##tions , do we not everywhere see inn ##ume ##rable transitional forms ? why is not all nature in confusion , instead of the species being , as we see them , well defined ? " darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms , combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms , often leading to extinction of such forms . this difficulty can be referred to as the absence or ra ##rity of transitional varieties in habitat space .
in order to preserve separately created species [SEP] chapter viii addresses the idea that species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile in order to preserve separately created species . darwin said that , far from being constant , the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species , and the via ##bility and fertility of the hybrids , varied greatly , especially among plants . sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely , and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty . darwin concluded : " finally , then , the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to , but even rather to support the view , that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties . "
to respond to criticisms of earlier editions [SEP] in the sixth edition darwin inserted a new chapter vii ( ren ##umber ##ing the subsequent chapters ) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions , including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and could not have been produced by natural selection . he said some such features could have been by - products of adaptive changes to other features , and that often features seemed non - adaptive because their function was unknown , as shown by his book on fe ##rti ##lis ##ation of orchid ##s that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated poll ##ination by insects . much of the chapter responds to george jackson mi ##var ##t ' s criticisms , including his claim that features such as bal ##een filters in whales , flat ##fish with both eyes on one side and the camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive . darwin proposed scenarios for the inc ##rem ##ental evolution of each feature .
so as not to prejudice readers against his theory [SEP] the final chapter reviews points from earlier chapters , and darwin concludes by hoping that his theory might produce revolutionary changes in many fields of natural history . although he avoids the controversial topic of human origins in the rest of the book so as not to prejudice readers against his theory , here he ventures a cautious hint that psychology would be put on a new foundation and that " light will be thrown on the origin of man " . darwin ends with a passage that became well known and much quoted :
because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to wallace ' s essay [SEP] while the book was read ##able enough to sell , its dry ##ness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not be dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction . unlike the still - popular vest ##ige ##s , it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and co ##smo ##logical speculation , though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression . darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science , and made effective use of his skills in st ##ru ##cturing arguments . david qu ##am ##men has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience , but noted that darwin ' s literary style was uneven : in some places he used con ##vo ##lu ##ted sentences that are difficult to read , while in other places his writing was beautiful . qu ##am ##men advised that later editions were weakened by darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics , and recommended the first edition . james t . costa said that because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to wallace ' s essay , it was more approach ##able than the big book on natural selection darwin had been working on , which would have been en ##cum ##bered by scholarly foot ##notes and much more technical detail . he added that some parts of origin are dense , but other parts are almost lyrical , and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books , which broad ##ened its audience .

no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological , social and religious implications [SEP] the book aroused international interest and a widespread debate , with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological , social and religious implications . much of the initial reaction was hostile , but darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science . there was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication vest ##ige ##s of creation , which had been rejected by scientists , but had influenced a wide public readers ##hip into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws . the origin of species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform . its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals , and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work , though it failed to match the continuing sales of vest ##ige ##s . darwin ' s book leg ##iti ##mise ##d scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms , and the newly coined term darwin ##ism was used to cover the whole range of evolution ##ism , not just his own ideas . by the mid - 1870s , evolution ##ism was triumphant .

as part of his efforts to secular ##ise and professional ##ise science [SEP] evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology , and at first had little impact on the research of the ana ##tom ##ist thomas henry hu ##xley . despite this , hu ##xley strongly supported darwin on evolution ; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species , and questioned if darwin ' s gradual ##ism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause spec ##iation . hu ##xley wanted science to be secular , without religious interference , and his article in the april 1860 westminster review promoted scientific natural ##ism over natural theology , praising darwin for " extending the domination of science over regions of thought into which she has , as yet , hardly penetrated " and coin ##ing the term " darwin ##ism " as part of his efforts to secular ##ise and professional ##ise science . hu ##xley gained influence , and initiated the x club , which used the journal nature to promote evolution and natural ##ism , shaping much of late victorian science . later , the german mor ##ph ##ologist ernst ha ##eck ##el would convince hu ##xley that comparative anatomy and pal ##ae ##ont ##ology could be used to rec ##ons ##truct evolutionary gene ##alo ##gies .
aiming to synthesis ##e darwin ' s ideas with those of lamar ##ck and goethe while still reflecting the spirit of nat ##ur ##phi ##los ##op ##hi ##e [SEP] evolutionary ideas , although not natural selection , were accepted by german biologist ##s accustomed to ideas of homo ##logy in morphology from goethe ' s meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis of plants and from their long tradition of comparative anatomy . bro ##nn ' s alterations in his german translation added to the mis ##giving ##s of conservatives , but en ##thus ##ed political radicals . ernst ha ##eck ##el was particularly ardent , aiming to synthesis ##e darwin ' s ideas with those of lamar ##ck and goethe while still reflecting the spirit of nat ##ur ##phi ##los ##op ##hi ##e . their ambitious programme to rec ##ons ##truct the evolutionary history of life was joined by hu ##xley and supported by discoveries in pal ##ae ##ont ##ology . ha ##eck ##el used embryo ##logy extensively in his rec ##ap ##it ##ulation theory , which embodied a progressive , almost linear model of evolution . darwin was cautious about such histories , and had already noted that von bae ##r ' s laws of embryo ##logy supported his idea of complex branching .
they believed evolution was purpose ##ful and progressive . [SEP] by the mid - 1870s , most scientists accepted evolution , but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purpose ##ful and progressive . the range of evolutionary theories during " the eclipse of darwin ##ism " included forms of " salt ##ation ##ism " in which new species were thought to arise through " jumps " rather than gradual adaptation , forms of or ##th ##ogen ##esis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction , and forms of neo - lamar ##cki ##sm in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress . the minority view of august wei ##sman ##n , that natural selection was the only mechanism , was called neo - darwin ##ism . it was thought that the red ##is ##co ##very of men ##del ##ian inheritance invalid ##ated darwin ' s views .
to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of caucasian ##s over non white races and justify european imperialism [SEP] while some , like spencer , used analogy from natural selection as an argument against government intervention in the economy to benefit the poor , others , including alfred russ ##el wallace , argued that action was needed to correct social and economic in ##e ##qui ##ties to level the playing field before natural selection could improve humanity further . some political commentaries , including walter bag ##eh ##ot ' s physics and politics ( 1872 ) , attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races . such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in anthropology to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of caucasian ##s over non white races and justify european imperialism . historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of darwin ' s scientific theory , and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution , such as the lamar ##cki ##an ideas of spencer and ha ##eck ##el , as they were by darwin ' s work . darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and une ##thic ##al business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans , and he opposed poly ##gen ##ism , the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry .
death [SEP] mikhail go ##rba ##chev was elected general secretary by the pol ##it ##buro on march 11 , 1985 , three hours after predecessor konstantin cher ##nen ##ko ' s death at age 73 . go ##rba ##chev , aged 54 , was the youngest member of the pol ##it ##buro . his initial goal as general secretary was to revive the soviet economy , and he realized that doing so would require reforming underlying political and social structures . the reforms began with personnel changes of senior br ##ez ##hn ##ev - era officials who would imp ##ede political and economic change . on april 23 , 1985 , go ##rba ##chev brought two protege ##s , ye ##gor liga ##chev and nikolai ry ##zh ##kov , into the pol ##it ##buro as full members . he kept the " power " ministries happy by promoting kgb head viktor che ##bri ##kov from candidate to full member and appointing minister of defence marshal sergei so ##ko ##lov as a pol ##it ##buro candidate .
suppressed by military force [SEP] the six warsaw pact countries of eastern europe , while nominally independent , were widely recognized in the international community as the soviet satellite states . all had been occupied by the soviet red army in 1945 , had soviet - style socialist states imposed upon them , and had very restricted freedom of action in either domestic or international affairs . any moves towards real independence were suppressed by military force – in the hungarian revolution of 1956 and the prague spring in 1968 . go ##rba ##chev abandoned the oppressive and expensive br ##ez ##hn ##ev doctrine , which mandated intervention in the warsaw pact states , in favor of non - intervention in the internal affairs of allies – joking ##ly termed the sinatra doctrine in a reference to the frank sinatra song " my way " .
radical ##ized [SEP] on april 7 , 1989 , soviet troops and armored personnel carriers were sent to tbilisi after more than 100 , 000 people protested in front of communist party headquarters with banners calling for georgia to sec ##ede from the soviet union and for ab ##kha ##zia to be fully integrated into georgia . on april 9 , 1989 , troops attacked the demonstrators ; some 20 people were killed and more than 200 wounded . this event radical ##ized georgian politics , prompting many to conclude that independence was prefer ##able to continued soviet rule . on april 14 , go ##rba ##chev removed ju ##mber pat ##ias ##h ##vili as first secretary of the georgian communist party and replaced him with former georgian kgb chief gi ##vi gum ##bari ##d ##ze .
a " double sabbath " caused by an extra pass ##over sabbath [SEP] the consensus of modern scholarship is that the new testament accounts represent a cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion occurring on a friday , but a thursday or wednesday cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion have also been proposed . some scholars explain a thursday cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion based on a " double sabbath " caused by an extra pass ##over sabbath falling on thursday dusk to friday afternoon , ahead of the normal weekly sabbath . some have argued that jesus was cr ##uc ##ified on wednesday , not friday , on the grounds of the mention of " three days and three nights " in matthew before his resurrection , celebrated on sunday . others have countered by saying that this ignores the jewish id ##iom by which a " day and night " may refer to any part of a 24 - hour period , that the expression in matthew is id ##iom ##atic , not a statement that jesus was 72 hours in the tomb , and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights .
on the grounds of the mention of " three days and three nights " in matthew [SEP] the consensus of modern scholarship is that the new testament accounts represent a cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion occurring on a friday , but a thursday or wednesday cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion have also been proposed . some scholars explain a thursday cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion based on a " double sabbath " caused by an extra pass ##over sabbath falling on thursday dusk to friday afternoon , ahead of the normal weekly sabbath . some have argued that jesus was cr ##uc ##ified on wednesday , not friday , on the grounds of the mention of " three days and three nights " in matthew before his resurrection , celebrated on sunday . others have countered by saying that this ignores the jewish id ##iom by which a " day and night " may refer to any part of a 24 - hour period , that the expression in matthew is id ##iom ##atic , not a statement that jesus was 72 hours in the tomb , and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights .
based on the use of roman time ##keeping in john but not in mark [SEP] in mark 15 : 25 cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion takes place at the third hour ( 9 a . m . ) and jesus ' death at the ninth hour ( 3 p . m . ) . however , in john 19 : 14 jesus is still before pi ##late at the sixth hour . scholars have presented a number of arguments to deal with the issue , some suggesting a reconciliation , e . g . , based on the use of roman time ##keeping in john but not in mark , yet others have rejected the arguments . several notable scholars have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be read back into the gospel accounts , written at a time when no standardization of time ##piece ##s , or exact recording of hours and minutes was available , and time was often approximate ##d to the closest three - hour period .
the greek and latin words used in the earliest christian writings are ambiguous [SEP] whereas most christians believe the gi ##bbe ##t on which jesus was executed was the traditional two - beamed cross , the je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses hold the view that a single upright stake was used . the greek and latin words used in the earliest christian writings are ambiguous . the ko ##ine greek terms used in the new testament are st ##aur ##os ( σ ##τ ##α ##υ ##ρ ##ος ) and x ##yl ##on ( ξ ##υ ##λ ##ο ##ν ) . the latter means wood ( a live tree , timber or an object constructed of wood ) ; in earlier forms of greek , the former term meant an upright stake or pole , but in ko ##ine greek it was used also to mean a cross . the latin word cr ##ux was also applied to objects other than a cross .
cr ##ux was also applied to objects other than a cross [SEP] whereas most christians believe the gi ##bbe ##t on which jesus was executed was the traditional two - beamed cross , the je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses hold the view that a single upright stake was used . the greek and latin words used in the earliest christian writings are ambiguous . the ko ##ine greek terms used in the new testament are st ##aur ##os ( σ ##τ ##α ##υ ##ρ ##ος ) and x ##yl ##on ( ξ ##υ ##λ ##ο ##ν ) . the latter means wood ( a live tree , timber or an object constructed of wood ) ; in earlier forms of greek , the former term meant an upright stake or pole , but in ko ##ine greek it was used also to mean a cross . the latin word cr ##ux was also applied to objects other than a cross .
a symbol of the suffering [SEP] however , early christian writers who speak of the shape of the particular gi ##bbe ##t on which jesus died invariably describe it as having a cross - beam . for instance , the ep ##istle of barn ##abas , which was certainly earlier than 135 , and may have been of the 1st century ad , the time when the gospel accounts of the death of jesus were written , likened it to the letter t ( the greek letter tau , which had the nu ##meric value of 300 ) , and to the position assumed by moses in exodus 17 : 11 – 12 . justin martyr ( 100 – 165 ) explicitly says the cross of christ was of two - beam shape : " that lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which christ would undergo . for the lamb , which is roasted , is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross . for one spit is trans ##fixed right through from the lower parts up to the head , and one across the back , to which are attached the legs of the lamb . " ir ##ena ##eus , who died around the end of the 2nd century , speaks of the cross as having " five ex ##tre ##mit ##ies , two in length , two in breadth , and one in the middle , on which [ last ] the person rests who is fixed by the nails . "
the hands may not have been able to support the weight [SEP] another issue has been the use of a h ##yp ##op ##od ##ium as a standing platform to support the feet , given that the hands may not have been able to support the weight . in the 17th century ras ##mus bart ##hol ##in considered a number of analytical scenarios of that topic . in the 20th century , forensic path ##ologist frederick zu ##gi ##be performed a number of cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion experiments by using ropes to hang human subjects at various angles and hand positions . his experiments support an angled suspension , and a two - beamed cross , and perhaps some form of foot support , given that in an auf ##bin ##den form of suspension from a straight stake ( as used by the nazis in the da ##cha ##u concentration camp during world war ii ) , death comes rather quickly .
the full moon [SEP] some christian writers considered the possibility that pagan commentators may have mentioned this event , mist ##aking it for a solar eclipse - although this would have been impossible during the pass ##over , which takes place at the full moon . christian traveller and historian sex ##tus julius african ##us and christian theologian or ##igen refer to greek historian ph ##leg ##on , who lived in the 2nd century ad , as having written " with regard to the eclipse in the time of tiberius caesar , in whose reign jesus appears to have been cr ##uc ##ified , and the great earthquakes which then took place "
sake of eventual victory [SEP] in johann ##ine " agent christ ##ology " the submission of jesus to cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion is a sacrifice made as an agent of god or servant of god , for the sake of eventual victory . this builds on the sal ##vi ##fi ##c theme of the gospel of john which begins in john 1 : 29 with john the baptist ' s proclamation : " the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world " . further reinforcement of the concept is provided in revelation 21 : 14 where the " lamb slain but standing " is the only one worthy of handling the scroll ( i . e . the book ) containing the names of those who are to be saved .
obedience to the father [SEP] john calvin supported the " agent of god " christ ##ology and argued that in his trial in pi ##late ' s court jesus could have successfully argued for his innocence , but instead submitted to cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion in obedience to the father . this christ ##ological theme continued into the 20th century , both in the eastern and western churches . in the eastern church sergei bu ##lga ##kov argued that the cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion of jesus was " pre - eternal ##ly " determined by the father before the creation of the world , to red ##eem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of adam . in the western church , karl ra ##hner elaborated on the analogy that the blood of the lamb of god ( and the water from the side of jesus ) shed at the cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion had a cleansing nature , similar to baptism ##al water .
an act of perfect obedience [SEP] jesus ' death and resurrection under ##pin a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity . these interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of jesus as compared to his words . according to the substitution ##ary at ##one ##ment view , jesus ' death is of central importance , and jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased god . by contrast the moral influence theory of at ##one ##ment focuses much more on the moral content of jesus ' teaching , and sees jesus ' death as a martyr ##dom . since the middle ages there has been conflict between these two views within western christianity . evangelical protestants typically hold a substitution ##ary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution . liberal protestants typically reject substitution ##ary at ##one ##ment and hold to the moral influence theory of at ##one ##ment . both views are popular within the roman catholic church , with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of pena ##nce .
ancient scribe ##s made alterations when copying manuscripts by hand [SEP] textual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship , philology , and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants in either manuscripts or printed books . ancient scribe ##s made alterations when copying manuscripts by hand . given a manuscript copy , several or many copies , but not the original document , the textual critic might seek to rec ##ons ##truct the original text ( the arch ##ety ##pe or auto ##graph ) as closely as possible . the same processes can be used to attempt to rec ##ons ##truct intermediate versions , or rec ##ens ##ions , of a document ' s transcription history . the ultimate objective of the textual critic ' s work is the production of a " critical edition " containing a scholarly curated text .
biblical books that are letters , like greek plays , presumably had one original [SEP] many ancient works , such as the bible and the greek tr ##aged ##ies , [ citation needed ] survive in hundreds of copies , and the relationship of each copy to the original may be unclear . textual scholars have debated for centuries which sources are most closely derived from the original , hence which readings in those sources are correct . [ citation needed ] although biblical books that are letters , like greek plays , presumably had one original , the question of whether some biblical books , like the gospels , ever had just one original has been discussed . interest in applying textual criticism to the qur ' an has also developed after the discovery of the san ##a ' a manuscripts in 1972 , which possibly date back to the 7 – 8th centuries .
the question of whether some biblical books , like the gospels , ever had just one original has been discussed [SEP] many ancient works , such as the bible and the greek tr ##aged ##ies , [ citation needed ] survive in hundreds of copies , and the relationship of each copy to the original may be unclear . textual scholars have debated for centuries which sources are most closely derived from the original , hence which readings in those sources are correct .

is , to the devout , taboo . [SEP] in the english language , the works of shakespeare have been a particularly fertile ground for textual criticism — both because the texts , as transmitted , contain a considerable amount of variation , and because the effort and expense of producing superior editions of his works have always been widely viewed as worth ##while . the principles of textual criticism , although originally developed and refined for works of antiquity , the bible , and shakespeare , have been applied to many works , extending backwards from the present to the earliest known written documents , in mesopotamia and egypt — a period of about five millennia . however , the application of textual criticism to non - religious works does not ant ##eda ##te the invention of printing . while christianity has been relatively rec ##eptive to textual criticism , application of it to the jewish ( mas ##ore ##tic ) torah and the qur ' an is , to the devout , taboo . [ citation needed ]
split in the tradition [SEP] ma ##as comments further that " a di ##cta ##tion revised by the author must be regarded as equivalent to an auto ##graph manuscript " . the lack of auto ##graph manuscripts applies to many cultures other than greek and roman . in such a situation , a key objective becomes the identification of the first ex ##em ##pl ##ar before any split in the tradition . that ex ##em ##pl ##ar is known as the arch ##ety ##pe . " if we succeed in establishing the text of [ the arch ##ety ##pe ] , the con ##sti ##tu ##ti ##o ( reconstruction of the original ) is considerably advanced .
literature was copied by hand [SEP] before mechanical printing , literature was copied by hand , and many variations were introduced by copy ##ists . the age of printing made the sc ##ri ##bal profession effectively redundant . printed editions , while less susceptible to the proliferation of variations likely to arise during manual transmission , are nonetheless not immune to introducing variations from an author ' s auto ##graph . instead of a scribe mis ##co ##py ##ing his source , a com ##po ##sitor or a printing shop may read or types ##et a work in a way that differs from the auto ##graph . since each scribe or printer commits different errors , reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources . an edited text that draws from multiple sources is said to be eclectic . in contrast to this approach , some textual critics prefer to identify the single best surviving text , and not to combine readings from multiple sources .
so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition . [SEP] when comparing different documents , or " witnesses " , of a single , original text , the observed differences are called variant readings , or simply variants or readings . it is not always apparent which single variant represents the author ' s original work . the process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text , either by accident ( du ##plication or om ##iss ##ion ) or intention ( harmon ##ization or censorship ) , as scribe ##s or supervisors transmitted the original author ' s text by copying it . the textual critic ' s task , therefore , is to sort through the variants , eliminating those most likely to be un - original , hence establishing a " critical text " , or critical edition , that is intended to best approximate the original . at the same time , the critical text should document variant readings , so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition . in establishing the critical text , the textual critic considers both " external " evidence ( the age , proven ##ance , and affiliation of each witness ) and " internal " or " physical " considerations ( what the author and scribe ##s , or printers , were likely to have done ) .
a second edition of a shakespeare play may include an addition all ##uding to an event known to have happened between the two editions [SEP] eclectic readings also normally give an impression of the number of witnesses to each available reading . although a reading supported by the majority of witnesses is frequently preferred , this does not follow automatically . for example , a second edition of a shakespeare play may include an addition all ##uding to an event known to have happened between the two editions . although nearly all subsequent manuscripts may have included the addition , textual critics may rec ##ons ##truct the original without the addition .
since errors tend to accumulate , older manuscripts should have fewer errors . [SEP] external evidence is evidence of each physical witness , its date , source , and relationship to other known witnesses . critics will often prefer the readings supported by the oldest witnesses . since errors tend to accumulate , older manuscripts should have fewer errors . readings supported by a majority of witnesses are also usually preferred , since these are less likely to reflect accidents or individual bias ##es . for the same reasons , the most geographically diverse witnesses are preferred . some manuscripts show evidence that particular care was taken in their composition , for example , by including alternative readings in their margins , demonstrating that more than one prior copy ( ex ##em ##pl ##ar ) was consulted in producing the current one . other factors being equal , these are the best witnesses . the role of the textual critic is necessary when these basic criteria are in conflict . for instance , there will typically be fewer early copies , and a larger number of later copies . the textual critic will attempt to balance these criteria , to determine the original text .
the method was tending to produce bi ##par ##tite stem ##mas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses . [SEP] the critic joseph bed ##ier ( 1864 – 1938 ) launched a particularly with ##ering attack on stem ##matic ##s in 1928 . he surveyed editions of medieval french texts that were produced with the stem ##matic method , and found that textual critics tended overwhelmingly to produce trees divided into just two branches . he concluded that this outcome was unlikely to have occurred by chance , and that therefore , the method was tending to produce bi ##par ##tite stem ##mas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses . he suspected that editors tended to favor trees with two branches , as this would maximize the opportunities for editorial judgment ( as there would be no third branch to " break the tie " whenever the witnesses disagreed ) . he also noted that , for many works , more than one reasonable stem ##ma could be post ##ulated , suggesting that the method was not as rigorous or as scientific as its proponents had claimed .

devi ##ate more widely than the earliest print from the author ' s original manuscript . " [SEP] by 1939 , in his pro ##leg ##ome ##na for the oxford shakespeare , mc ##ker ##row had changed his mind about this approach , as he feared that a later edition – even if it contained author ##ial corrections – would " devi ##ate more widely than the earliest print from the author ' s original manuscript . " he therefore concluded that the correct procedure would be " produced by using the earliest " good " print as copy - text and insert ##ing into it , from the first edition which contains them , such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author . " but , fearing the arbitrary exercise of editorial judgment , mc ##ker ##row stated that , having concluded that a later edition had substantive revisions at ##tri ##bu ##table to the author , " we must accept all the alterations of that edition , saving any which seem obvious blu ##nder ##s or mis ##print ##s . "
to obtain fine readings [SEP] in 1988 , with that preliminary phase of the project completed , professor sk ##ouse ##n took over as editor and head of the farms critical text of the book of mormon project and proceeded to gather still scattered fragments of the original manuscript of the book of mormon and to have advanced photographic techniques applied to obtain fine readings from otherwise un ##rea ##dable pages and fragments . he also closely examined the printer ’ s manuscript ( owned by the community of christ — r ##ld ##s church in independence , missouri ) for differences in types of ink or pencil , in order to determine when and by whom they were made . he also col ##lated the various editions of the book of mormon down to the present to see what sorts of changes have been made through time .
lack of sales for the single , and a lack of general interest [SEP] in 1968 , reprise planned to release a series of 78 rpm singles from their artists on their label at the time , called the reprise speed series . only one disc actually saw release , randy newman ' s i think it ' s going to rain today , a track from his self - titled debut album ( with the bee ##hi ##ve state on the flip ##side ) . reprise did not proceed further with the series due to a lack of sales for the single , and a lack of general interest in the concept . guitarist & vocalist leon red ##bone released a promotional 78 rpm record in 1978 featuring two songs ( alabama jubilee and please don ' t talk about me when i ' m gone ) from his champagne charlie album . in 1980 stiff records in the united kingdom issued a 78 by joe " king " carr ##asco containing the songs buena ( spanish for " good , " with the alternate spelling " bu ##eno " on the label ) and tu ##ff en ##uf ##f . underground comic cartoonist and 78 rpm record collector robert cr ##umb released three discs with his cheap suit serena ##ders in the 1980s .
world war ii [SEP] beginning in 1939 , dr . peter gold ##mark and his staff at columbia records and at cbs laboratories undertook efforts to address problems of recording and playing back narrow grooves and developing an inexpensive , reliable consumer playback system . it took about eight years of study , except when it was suspended because of world war ii . finally , the 12 - inch ( 30 cm ) long play ( lp ) 33 1 ##⁄ ##3 rpm micro ##gr ##oo ##ve record album was introduced by the columbia record company at a new york press conference on june 18 , 1948 .
noel pe ##mber ##ton billing ' s patented add - on governor device [SEP] one early attempt at length ##ening the playing time should be mentioned . at least one manufacturer in the early 1920s , world records , produced records that played at a constant linear velocity , controlled by noel pe ##mber ##ton billing ' s patented add - on governor device . as these were played from the outside to the inside , the rotational speed of the records increased as reproduction progressed . this action is similar ( although in reverse ) to that on the modern compact disc and the cl ##v version of its predecessor , the philips laser disc .
to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats [SEP] in 1925 , 78 . 26 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered sync ##hr ##ono ##us turn ##table motor . this motor ran at 360 ##0 rpm , such that a 46 : 1 gear ratio would produce 78 . 26 rpm . in parts of the world that used 50 hz current , the standard was 77 . 92 rpm ( 3 , 000 rpm with a 77 : 2 ratio ) , which was also the speed at which a st ##ro ##be disc with 77 lines would " stand still " in 50 hz light ( 92 lines for 60 hz ) . after world war ii these records were retro ##active ##ly known as 78 ##s , to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats . earlier they were just called records , or when there was a need to distinguish them from cylinders , disc records .
45 rpm player was a luxury few could afford at the time [SEP] some of elvis presley ' s early singles on sun records might have sold more copies on 78 than on 45 . this is because the majority of those sales in 1954 – 55 were to the " hill ##bill ##y " market in the south and southwestern united states , where replacing the family 78 rpm player with a new 45 rpm player was a luxury few could afford at the time . by the end of 1957 , rca victor announced that 78 ##s accounted for less than 10 % of presley ' s singles sales , essentially announcing the death th ##ro ##es of the 78 rpm format . the last presley single released on 78 in the united states was rca victor 20 - 74 ##10 , i got stung / one night ( 1958 ) , while the last 78 in the uk was rca 119 ##4 , a mess of blues / girl of my best friend ( 1960 ) .
poor performance [SEP] some recordings , such as books for the blind , were pressed at 16 2 ##⁄ ##3 rpm . prestige records released jazz records in this format in the late 1950s ; for example , two of their miles davis albums were paired together in this format . peter gold ##mark , the man who developed the 33 1 ##⁄ ##3 rpm record , developed the highway hi - fi 16 2 ##⁄ ##3 rpm record to be played in chrysler automobiles , but poor performance of the system and weak implementation by chrysler and columbia led to the demise of the 16 2 ##⁄ ##3 rpm records . subsequently , the 16 2 ##⁄ ##3 rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired , and were never widely commercially available , although it was common to see new turn ##table models with a 16 rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s .
the large center hole [SEP] the 45 rpm discs also came in a variety known as extended play ( ep ) , which achieved up to 10 – 15 minutes play at the expense of at ##ten ##uating ( and possibly com ##pressing ) the sound to reduce the width required by the groove . ep discs were cheaper to produce , and were used in cases where unit sales were likely to be more limited or to reissue lp albums on the smaller format for those people who had only 45 rpm players . lp albums could be purchased 1 ep at a time , with four items per ep , or in a boxed set with 3 eps or 12 items . the large center hole on 45 ##s allows for easier handling by ju ##ke ##box mechanisms . eps were generally discontinued by the late 1950s in the u . s . as three - and four - speed record players replaced the individual 45 players . one indication of the decline of the 45 rpm ep is that the last columbia records reissue of frank sinatra songs on 45 rpm ep records , called frank sinatra ( columbia b - 264 ##1 ) was issued on december 7 , 1959 . the ep lasted considerably longer in europe , and was a popular format during the 1960s for recordings by artists such as serge gains ##bourg and the beatles .
variety of improvements in recording and playback technologies [SEP] the term " high fidelity " was coined in the 1920s by some manufacturers of radio receivers and ph ##ono ##graphs to differentiate their better - sounding products claimed as providing " perfect " sound reproduction . the term began to be used by some audio engineers and consumers through the 1930s and 1940s . after 1949 a variety of improvements in recording and playback technologies , especially stereo recordings , which became widely available in 1958 , gave a boost to the " hi - fi " classification of products , leading to sales of individual components for the home such as amplifiers , loud ##sp ##eak ##ers , ph ##ono ##graphs , and tape players . high fidelity and audio were two magazines that hi - fi consumers and engineers could read for reviews of playback equipment and recordings .
unnatural side effects [SEP] through the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s , various methods to improve the dynamic range of mass - produced records involved highly advanced disc cutting equipment . these techniques , marketed , to name two , as the cbs disco ##mp ##uter and tel ##de ##c direct metal mastering , were used to reduce inner - groove distortion . rca victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of d ##yna ##gr ##oo ##ve . two main elements were combined : another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for mask ##ing background noise . sometimes this was called " dia ##ph ##rag ##ming " the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects . both elements were reflected in the brand ##name of d ##yna ##gr ##oo ##ve , described elsewhere in more detail . it also used the earlier advanced method of forward - looking control on groove spa ##cing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk . lower recorded volume used closer spa ##cing ; higher recorded volume used wider spa ##cing , especially with lower frequencies . also , the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end farther away from the disk center than usual , helping to reduce end ##tra ##ck distortion even further .
dust and scratches [SEP] vinyl records do not break easily , but the soft material is easily scratched . vinyl readily acquire ##s a static charge , attracting dust that is difficult to remove completely . dust and scratches cause audio clicks and pops . in extreme cases , they can cause the needle to skip over a series of grooves , or worse yet , cause the needle to skip backwards , creating a " locked groove " that repeats over and over . this is the origin of the phrase " like a broken record " or " like a scratched record " , which is often used to describe a person or thing that continually repeats itself . locked grooves are not uncommon and were even heard occasionally in radio broadcasts .
heat , improper storage , exposure to sunlight , or manufacturing defects [SEP] vinyl records can be warped by heat , improper storage , exposure to sunlight , or manufacturing defects such as excessive ##ly tight plastic shrink ##wr ##ap on the album cover . a small degree of warp was common , and allowing for it was part of the art of turn ##table and tone ##arm design . " wow " ( once - per - revolution pitch variation ) could result from warp , or from a spin ##dle hole that was not precisely centered . standard practice for lp ##s was to place the lp in a paper or plastic inner cover . this , if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover , was said to reduce ing ##ress of dust onto the record surface . singles , with rare exceptions , had simple paper covers with no inner cover .

distortion [SEP] a further limitation of the gram ##ophone record is that fidelity steadily declines as playback progresses ; there is more vinyl per second available for fine reproduction of high frequencies at the large - diameter beginning of the groove than exist at the smaller - diameter ##s close to the end of the side . at the start of a groove on an lp there are 510 mm of vinyl per second traveling past the st ##ylus while the ending of the groove gives 200 – 210 mm of vinyl per second — less than half the linear resolution . distortion towards the end of the side is likely to become more apparent as record wear increases . *
recording amplitude increased [SEP] in 1926 joseph p . maxwell and henry c . harrison from bell telephone laboratories disclosed that the recording pattern of the western electric " rubber line " magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic . this meant that as frequency increased in the tre ##ble , recording amplitude decreased . conversely , in the bass as frequency decreased , recording amplitude increased . therefore , it was necessary to at ##ten ##uate the bass frequencies below about 250 hz , the bass turnover point , in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head . otherwise , bass modulation became excessive and over ##cut ##ting took place into the next record groove . when played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region , a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary . g . h . miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records , the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form .
help mute these resonance ##s [SEP] delicate sounds and fine over ##tones were mostly lost , because it took a lot of sound energy to vi ##brate the recording horn dia ##ph ##rag ##m and cutting mechanism . there were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonance ##s in both the recording and playback system . some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonance ##s . even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn , notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback . toward the end of the acoustic era , there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns .
medical leave [SEP] most feature movies shown during the prime time and early overnight hours ( 8 : 00 p . m . to 2 : 30 a . m . eastern time ) are presented by film historian robert osborne ( who has been with the network since its 1994 launch , except for a five - month medical leave from july to december 2011 , when guest hosts presented each night ' s films ) on sunday through wednesday evenings – with osborne only presenting primetime films on weekends – and ben man ##kiewicz presenting only late evening films on thursday ##s , and the " silent sunday nights " and " tc ##m imports " blocks on sundays .
increased scrutiny of donations there has been a long - term decline in party membership ##s [SEP] from the second half of the 20th century on parties which continued to rely on donations or membership subscription ##s ran into mounting problems . along with the increased scrutiny of donations there has been a long - term decline in party membership ##s in most western demo ##cr ##acies which itself places more strains on funding . for example , in the united kingdom and australia membership of the two main parties in 2006 is less than an 1 / 8 of what it was in 1950 , despite significant increases in population over that period .
they were considered a catholic innovation [SEP] instruments have divided christ ##end ##om since their introduction into worship . they were considered a catholic innovation , not widely practiced until the 18th century , and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of protestant reformer ##s , including martin luther ( 148 ##3 – 154 ##6 ) , ulrich z ##wing ##li , john calvin ( 150 ##9 – 156 ##4 ) and john wesley ( 1703 – 1791 ) . alexander campbell referred to the use of an instrument in worship as " a cow bell in a concert " . in sir walter scott ' s the heart of mid ##lot ##hian , the heroine , jean ##ie dean ##s , a scottish presbyterian , writes to her father about the church situation she has found in england ( bold added ) :
to help his neighbors [SEP] as an adolescent , he had a particular love of theology and the scriptures became the foundation of his spirituality . during his studies in pale ##ncia , spain , he experienced a dreadful famine , prompting dominic to sell all of his beloved books and other equipment to help his neighbors . after he completed his studies , bishop martin ba ##zan and prior diego d ' ache ##bes appointed dominic to the cathedral chapter and he became a regular canon under the rule of st . augustine and the constitution ##s for the cathedral church of os ##ma . at the age of twenty - four or twenty - five , he was ordained to the priesthood .
to arrange the marriage between the son of king alfonso viii of castile and a niece of king val ##de ##mar ii of denmark [SEP] in 120 ##3 , dominic joined prior diego de ace ##bo on an embassy to denmark for the monarchy of spain , to arrange the marriage between the son of king alfonso viii of castile and a niece of king val ##de ##mar ii of denmark . at that time the south of france was the stronghold of the cat ##har or al ##bi ##gens ##ian heresy , named after the duke of al ##bi , a cat ##har sy ##mp ##athi ##ser and opponent to the subsequent al ##bi ##gens ##ian crusade ( 120 ##9 – 122 ##9 ) . dominic was fired by a reforming ze ##al after they encountered al ##bi ##gens ##ian christians at toulouse .
too poor [SEP] dominic became the spiritual father to several al ##bi ##gens ##ian women he had reconciled to the faith , and in 120 ##6 he established them in a convent in pro ##uil ##le . this convent would become the foundation of the dominican nuns , thus making the dominican nuns older than the dominican friars . prior diego sanctioned the building of a monastery for girls whose parents had sent them to the care of the al ##bi ##gens ##ians because their families were too poor to fulfill their basic needs . the monastery was at pro ##uil ##le would later become dominic ' s headquarters for his missionary effort there . after two years on the mission field , prior diego died while traveling back to spain . when his preaching companions heard of his death , all save dominic and a very small number of others returned to their homes .
its direct supervisors were from england [SEP] the english province was a component of the international order from which it obtained its laws , direction , and instructions . it was also , however , a group of english ##men . its direct supervisors were from england , and the members of the english province d ##we ##lt and labor ##ed in english cities , towns , villages , and roadway ##s . english and european ingredients constantly came in contact . the international side of the province ' s existence influenced the national , and the national responded to , adapted , and sometimes constrained the international .
it was decided that a more local project ( at do ##rney ) would be more realistic [SEP] as with other public schools , a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiar ##ize privileged school ##boys with social conditions in deprived areas . the project of establishing an ' eton mission ' in the crowded district of hackney wi ##ck in east london was started at the beginning of 1880 , and lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project ( at do ##rney ) would be more realistic . however over the years much money was raised for the eton mission , a fine church by g . f . bo ##dley was erected , many eton ##ians visited , and stimulated among other things the eton manor boys ' club , a notable rowing club which has survived the mission itself , and the 59 club for motor ##cy ##cl ##ists .
the can ##ing would cut the cloth to sh ##red ##s [SEP] john ke ##ate , head master from 1809 to 1834 , took over at a time when discipline was poor . anthony chen ##ev ##ix - trench , head master from 1964 to 1970 , abolished the birch and replaced it with can ##ing , also applied to the bare posterior , which he administered privately in his office . chen ##ev ##ix - trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys . previously , house captains were permitted to cane mis ##cre ##ants over the seat of the trousers . this was a routine occurrence , carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table . less common but more severe were the can ##ings administered by pop ( see eton society below ) in the form of a " pop - tan ##ning " , in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the president of pop in the presence of all pop members ( or , in earlier times , each member of pop took it in turns to in ##flict a stroke ) . the cu ##lp ##rit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers , as the can ##ing would cut the cloth to sh ##red ##s . this was the most severe form of physical punishment at eton .
substantial tax breaks [SEP] until 18 december 2010 , eton college was an exempt charity under english law ( charities act 1993 , schedule 2 ) . under the provisions of the charities act 2006 , it is now an except ##ed charity , and fully registered with the charities commission , and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the uk . as a charity , it benefits from substantial tax breaks . it was calculated by the late david jewel ##l , former master of hailey ##bury , that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the school about £1 , 94 ##5 per pupil per year , although he had no direct connection with the school . this subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the labour government of state - funded scholarships ( formerly known as " assisted places " ) to independent schools . however , no child attended eton on this scheme , meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the school has always been lower . eton ' s retiring head master , tony little , has claimed that the benefits that eton provides to the local community free of charge ( use of its facilities , etc . ) have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status . the fee for the academic year 2010 – 2011 was £2 ##9 , 86 ##2 ( approximately us $ 48 , 600 or € ##35 , 100 as of march 2011 ) , although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bu ##rsa ##ries and scholarships .
black death [SEP] the city ' s municipal government was dominated by about 12 – 15 merchant families , whose wealth came from overseas trade with continental europe — in particular the export of wool and hides and the import of salt , iron and wine . the medieval population of cork was about 2 , 100 people . it suffered a severe blow in 134 ##9 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the black death arrived in the town . in 149 ##1 , cork played a part in the english wars of the roses when per ##kin war ##beck a pretend ##er to the english throne , landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow henry vii of england . the then mayor of cork and several important citizens went with war ##beck to england but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed . the title of mayor of cork was established by royal charter in 131 ##8 , and the title was changed to lord mayor in 1900 following the knight ##hood of the incumbent mayor by queen victoria on her royal visit to the city .
the airport is at an altitude of 151 metres ( 495 ft ) [SEP] the climate of cork , like the rest of ireland , is mild and change ##able with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes . cork lies in plant hardin ##ess zone 9 ##b . met eireann maintains a cl ##ima ##to ##logical weather station at cork airport , a few kilometres south of the city . it should be noted that the airport is at an altitude of 151 metres ( 495 ft ) and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the city itself . there are also smaller syn ##op ##tic weather stations at uc ##c and clover hill .
many retail spaces available for let [SEP] the retail trade in cork city includes a mix of both modern , state of the art shopping centres and family owned local shops . department stores cater for all budgets , with expensive boutique ##s for one end of the market and high street stores also available . shopping centres can be found in many of cork ' s suburbs , including blackpool , ball ##in ##coll ##ig , douglas , ball ##y ##vo ##lane , wilton and ma ##hon point . others are available in the city centre . these include the recently [ when ? ] completed development of two large malls the corn ##market centre on corn ##market street , and new the retail street called " opera lane " off st . patrick ' s street / academy street . the grand parade scheme , on the site of the former capitol ci ##ne ##plex , was planning - approved for 60 , 000 square feet ( 5 , 600 m2 ) of retail space , with work commencing in 2016 . cork ' s main shopping street is st . patrick ' s street and is the most expensive street in the country per sq . metre after dublin ' s grafton street . as of 2015 [ update ] this area has been impacted by the post - 2008 down ##turn , with many retail spaces available for let . [ citation needed ] other shopping areas in the city centre include oliver pl ##unk ##ett st . and grand parade . cork is also home to some of the country ' s leading department stores with the foundations of shops such as dunne ##s stores and the former roche ##s stores being laid in the city . outside the city centre is ma ##hon point shopping centre .
henry ford ' s grandfather was from west cork [SEP] the city is also home to the he ##ine ##ken brewery that brew ##s murphy ' s irish stout and the nearby beam ##ish and crawford brewery ( taken over by he ##ine ##ken in 2008 ) which have been in the city for generations . 45 % of the world ' s ti ##c ta ##c sweets are manufactured at the city ' s ferrer ##o factory . for many years , cork was the home to ford motor company , which manufactured cars in the dock ##lands area before the plant was closed in 1984 . henry ford ' s grandfather was from west cork , which was one of the main reasons for opening up the manufacturing facility in cork . but technology has replaced the old manufacturing businesses of the 1970s and 1980s , with people now working in the many i . t . centres of the city – such as amazon . com , the online retailer , which has set up in cork airport business park .
cork corporation refused permission to extend the line [SEP] within the city there have been two tram networks in operation . a proposal to develop a horse - drawn tram ( linking the city ' s railway term ##ini ) was made by american george francis train in the 1860s , and implemented in 1872 by the cork tramway company . however , the company ceased trading in 1875 after cork corporation refused permission to extend the line , mainly because of objections from cab operators to the type of tracks which – although they were laid to the irish national railway gauge of 5 ft 3 ##in – pro ##tr ##uded from the road surface .

to prevent electrical over ##load ##s and damaged equipment [SEP] unlike other data cables ( e . g . , ethernet , hd ##mi ) , each end of a usb cable uses a different kind of connector ; a type - a or a type - b . this kind of design was chosen to prevent electrical over ##load ##s and damaged equipment , as only the type - a socket provides power . there are cables with type - a connector ##s on both ends , but they should be used carefully . therefore , in general , each of the different " sizes " requires four different connector ##s ; usb cables have the type - a and type - b plug ##s , and the corresponding rec ##ept ##acle ##s are on the computer or electronic device . in common practice , the type - a connector is usually the full size , and the type - b side can vary as needed .
the en ##ume ##ration process is repeated for all connected devices . [SEP] when a usb device is first connected to a usb host , the usb device en ##ume ##ration process is started . the en ##ume ##ration starts by sending a reset signal to the usb device . the data rate of the usb device is determined during the reset signaling . after reset , the usb device ' s information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7 - bit address . if the device is supported by the host , the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state . if the usb host is restarted , the en ##ume ##ration process is repeated for all connected devices .
maintaining the integrity and non - corrupt ##ible , pristine state of the boot ##ing medium . [SEP] usb implements connections to storage devices using a set of standards called the usb mass storage device class ( msc or um ##s ) . this was at first intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and has been extended to support flash drives . it has also been extended to support a wide variety of novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within director ##ies . the process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension . the ability to boot a write - locked sd card with a usb adapt ##er is particularly advantage ##ous for maintaining the integrity and non - corrupt ##ible , pristine state of the boot ##ing medium .
to give higher - level access to a device ' s files ##yst ##em [SEP] media transfer protocol ( mt ##p ) was designed by microsoft to give higher - level access to a device ' s files ##yst ##em than usb mass storage , at the level of files rather than disk blocks . it also has optional dr ##m features . mt ##p was designed for use with portable media players , but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the android operating system from the version 4 . 1 jelly bean as well as windows phone 8 ( windows phone 7 devices had used the zu ##ne protocol which was an evolution of mt ##p ) . the primary reason for this is that mt ##p does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way um ##s does , all ##ev ##iating potential problems should an android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer . the main draw ##back is that mt ##p is not as well supported outside of windows operating systems .

the connector ##s would be used more frequently [SEP] the standard connector ##s were designed to be robust . because usb is hot - plug ##ga ##ble , the connector ##s would be used more frequently , and perhaps with less care , than other connector ##s . many previous connector designs were fragile , specify ##ing embedded component pins or other delicate parts that were vulnerable to bending or breaking . the electrical contacts in a usb connector are protected by an adjacent plastic tongue , and the entire connecting assembly is usually protected by an en ##cl ##osing metal sheath .
so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear [SEP] the newer micro - usb rec ##ept ##acle ##s are designed for a minimum rated lifetime of 10 , 000 cycles of insertion and removal between the rec ##ept ##acle and plug , compared to 1 , 500 for the standard usb and 5 , 000 for the mini - usb rec ##ept ##acle . features intended to accomplish include , a locking device was added and the leaf - spring was moved from the jack to the plug , so that the most - stressed part is on the cable side of the connection . this change was made so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear instead of the more expensive micro - usb device . however the idea that these changes did in fact make the connector more durable in real world use has been widely disputed , with many contend ##ing that they are in fact , much less durable .
to minimize physical inc ##omp ##ati ##bilities in connector ##s from different vendors [SEP] the usb standard specifies relatively loose tolerance ##s for compliant usb connector ##s to minimize physical inc ##omp ##ati ##bilities in connector ##s from different vendors . to address a weakness present in some other connector standards , the usb specification also defines limits to the size of a connecting device in the area around its plug . this was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the cable strain relief mechanism ( usually mold ##ing integral with the cable outer insulation ) at the connector . compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does .
power supply short ##ing hazards on the v ##bus line [SEP] all current usb on - the - go ( ot ##g ) devices are required to have one , and only one , usb connector : a micro - ab rec ##ept ##acle . non - ot ##g compliant devices are not allowed to use the micro - ab rec ##ept ##acle , due to power supply short ##ing hazards on the v ##bus line . the micro - ab rec ##ept ##acle is capable of accepting both micro - a and micro - b plug ##s , attached to any of the legal cables and adapt ##ers as defined in revision 1 . 01 of the micro - usb specification . prior to the development of micro - usb , usb on - the - go devices were required to use mini - ab rec ##ept ##acle ##s to perform the equivalent job .
it was one area on the road of the long march [SEP] the second sino - japanese war was soon followed by the resumed chinese civil war , and the cities of east china fell to the communists one after another , the ku ##omi ##nta ##ng government again tried to make sichuan its stronghold on the mainland , although it already saw some communist activity since it was one area on the road of the long march . chiang kai - she ##k himself flew to chong ##qing from taiwan in november 1949 to lead the defense . but the same month chong ##qing fell to the communists , followed by cheng ##du on 10 december . the ku ##omi ##nta ##ng general wang sheng wanted to stay behind with his troops to continue anti ##com ##mun ##ist gu ##eri ##lla war in sichuan , but was recalled to taiwan . many of his soldiers made their way there as well , via burma .
chong ##qing as well as the three surrounding prefecture ##s of fu ##ling , wan ##xia ##n , and qi ##an ##jiang were split off into the new chong ##qing municipality . [SEP] from 1955 until 1997 sichuan had been china ' s most populous province , hitting 100 million mark shortly after the 1982 census figure of 99 , 730 , 000 . this changed in 1997 when the sub - provincial city of chong ##qing as well as the three surrounding prefecture ##s of fu ##ling , wan ##xia ##n , and qi ##an ##jiang were split off into the new chong ##qing municipality . the new municipality was formed to spear ##head china ' s effort to economically develop its western provinces , as well as to coordinate the reset ##tlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the three gorge ##s dam project .

to make it trivial to convert existing western text [SEP] the first 256 code points were made identical to the content of iso - 88 ##59 - 1 so as to make it trivial to convert existing western text . many essentially identical characters were encoded multiple times at different code points to preserve distinctions used by legacy encoding ##s and therefore , allow conversion from those encoding ##s to unicode ( and back ) without losing any information . for example , the " full ##wi ##dt ##h forms " section of code points encompasses a full latin alphabet that is separate from the main latin alphabet section because in chinese , japanese , and korean ( c ##jk ) font ##s , these latin characters are rendered at the same width as c ##jk id ##eo ##graphs , rather than at half the width . for other examples , see duplicate characters in unicode .
so that unicode was no longer restricted to 16 bits [SEP] in 1996 , a sur ##rogate character mechanism was implemented in unicode 2 . 0 , so that unicode was no longer restricted to 16 bits . this increased the unicode codes ##pace to over a million code points , which allowed for the encoding of many historic scripts ( e . g . , egyptian hi ##ero ##gly ##phs ) and thousands of rarely used or obsolete characters that had not been anticipated as needing encoding . among the characters not originally intended for unicode are rarely used kan ##ji or chinese characters , many of which are part of personal and place names , making them rarely used , but much more essential than envisioned in the original architecture of unicode .
many of which are part of personal and place names [SEP] in 1996 , a sur ##rogate character mechanism was implemented in unicode 2 . 0 , so that unicode was no longer restricted to 16 bits . this increased the unicode codes ##pace to over a million code points , which allowed for the encoding of many historic scripts ( e . g . , egyptian hi ##ero ##gly ##phs ) and thousands of rarely used or obsolete characters that had not been anticipated as needing encoding . among the characters not originally intended for unicode are rarely used kan ##ji or chinese characters , many of which are part of personal and place names , making them rarely used , but much more essential than envisioned in the original architecture of unicode .

a formal alias may be defined [SEP] all graphic , format , and private use characters have a unique and im ##mut ##able name by which they may be identified . this im ##mut ##ability has been guaranteed since unicode version 2 . 0 by the name stability policy . in cases where the name is seriously defective and misleading , or has a serious ty ##po ##graphic ##al error , a formal alias may be defined , and applications are encouraged to use the formal alias in place of the official character name . for example , u + a ##01 ##5 [UNK] yi syllable wu has the formal alias yi syllable iteration mark , and u + fe ##18 [UNK] presentation form for vertical right white lent ##icular bra ##k ##ce ##t ( sic ) has the formal alias presentation form for vertical right white lent ##icular bracket .
the large restriction on possible patterns [SEP] the same character converted to ut ##f - 8 becomes the byte sequence e ##f bb bf . the unicode standard allows that the bo ##m " can serve as signature for ut ##f - 8 encoded text where the character set is unmarked " . some software developers have adopted it for other encoding ##s , including ut ##f - 8 , in an attempt to distinguish ut ##f - 8 from local 8 - bit code pages . however rfc 36 ##29 , the ut ##f - 8 standard , recommends that byte order marks be forbidden in protocols using ut ##f - 8 , but discusses the cases where this may not be possible . in addition , the large restriction on possible patterns in ut ##f - 8 ( for instance there cannot be any lone bytes with the high bit set ) means that it should be possible to distinguish ut ##f - 8 from other character encoding ##s without relying on the bo ##m .
com ##pl ##icate ##s the processing of ancient japanese and uncommon japanese names [SEP] unicode has been criticized for failing to separately en ##code older and alternative forms of kan ##ji which , critics argue , com ##pl ##icate ##s the processing of ancient japanese and uncommon japanese names . this is often due to the fact that unicode en ##codes characters rather than g ##ly ##phs ( the visual representations of the basic character that often vary from one language to another ) . unification of g ##ly ##phs leads to the perception that the languages themselves , not just the basic character representation , are being merged . [ cl ##ari ##fication needed ] there have been several attempts to create alternative encoding ##s that preserve the stylistic differences between chinese , japanese , and korean characters in opposition to unicode ' s policy of han unification . an example of one is tr ##on ( although it is not widely adopted in japan , there are some users who need to handle historical japanese text and favor it ) .
its ordering of thai characters [SEP] thai alphabet support has been criticized for its ordering of thai characters . the vowels เ , [UNK] , [UNK] , [UNK] , [UNK] that are written to the left of the preceding consonant are in visual order instead of phonetic order , unlike the unicode representations of other ind ##ic scripts . this com ##plication is due to unicode inherit ##ing the thai industrial standard 620 , which worked in the same way , and was the way in which thai had always been written on keyboards . this ordering problem com ##pl ##icate ##s the unicode col ##lation process slightly , requiring table look ##ups to re ##ord ##er thai characters for col ##lation . even if unicode had adopted encoding according to spoken order , it would still be problematic to col ##late words in dictionary order . e . g . , the word [UNK] [ sa d ##ɛ ##ː ##ŋ ] " perform " starts with a consonant cluster " [UNK] " ( with an inherent vowel for the consonant " ส " ) , the vowel [UNK] - , in spoken order would come after the [UNK] , but in a dictionary , the word is col ##lated as it is written , with the vowel following the ส .
jim crow [SEP] detroit remains one of the most racial ##ly segregated cities in the united states . from the 1940s to the 1970s a second wave of blacks moved to detroit to escape jim crow laws in the south and find jobs . however , they soon found themselves excluded from white areas of the city — through violence , laws , and economic discrimination ( e . g . , red ##lining ) . white residents attacked black homes : breaking windows , starting fires , and exploding bombs . the pattern of segregation was later mag ##nified by white migration to the suburbs . one of the implications of racial segregation , which co ##rre ##lates with class segregation , may be overall worse health for some populations .
the growth of the urban area [SEP] primarily starting in the mid - 1960s , london became a centre for the worldwide youth culture , exemplified by the swinging london sub ##culture associated with the king ' s road , chelsea and car ##na ##by street . the role of trends ##ette ##r was revived during the punk era . in 1965 london ' s political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new greater london council was created . during the troubles in northern ireland , london was subjected to bombing attacks by the provisional ira . racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 br ##ix ##ton riot .
to take advantage of the london ' s green spaces [SEP] herds of red and fall ##ow deer also roam freely within much of richmond and bush ##y park . a cu ##ll takes place each november and february to ensure numbers can be sustained . ep ##ping forest is also known for its fall ##ow deer , which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the forest . a rare population of mel ##ani ##stic , black fall ##ow deer is also maintained at the deer sanctuary near they ##don bois . mu ##nt ##ja ##c deer , which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century , are also found in the forest . while london ##ers are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city , more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature , and whole herds of fall ##ow and white - tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of the london ' s green spaces .
it has fewer underground lines . [SEP] there are 36 ##6 railway stations in the london travel ##card zones on an extensive above - ground suburban railway network . south london , particularly , has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer underground lines . most rail lines terminate around the centre of london , running into eighteen terminal stations , with the exception of the thames ##link trains connecting bedford in the north and brighton in the south via luton and ga ##t ##wick airports . london has britain ' s busiest station by number of passengers – waterloo , with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex ( which includes waterloo east station ) each year . clap ##ham junction is the busiest station in europe by the number of trains passing .
inter ##tropical convergence zone [SEP] the average annual rainfall ranges from very low in the northern and southern fringe ##s of the desert to nearly non - existent over the central and the eastern part . the thin northern fringe of the desert receives more winter cloud ##iness and rainfall due to the arrival of low pressure systems over the mediterranean sea along the polar front , although very at ##ten ##uated by the rain shadow effects of the mountains and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 mm ( 3 , 93 in ) to 250 mm ( 9 , 84 in ) . for example , bis ##kra , algeria and ou ##ar ##za ##za ##te , morocco are found in this zone . the southern fringe of the desert along the border with the sa ##hel receives summer cloud ##iness and rainfall due to the arrival of the inter ##tropical convergence zone from the south and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 mm ( 3 , 93 in ) to 250 mm ( 9 , 84 in ) . for example , tim ##bu ##kt ##u , mali and ag ##ade ##z , niger are found in this zone . the vast central hyper - arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by north ##erly or south ##erly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remains under the influence of the strongest anti ##cy ##cl ##onic weather regime and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than 1 mm ( 0 . 04 in ) . in fact , most of the sahara receives less than 20 mm ( 0 . 79 in ) . of the 9 , 000 , 000 km ##2 of desert land in the sahara , an area of about 2 , 800 , 000 km ##2 ( about 31 % of the total area ) receives an annual average rainfall amount of 10 mm ( 0 . 39 in ) or less , while some 1 , 500 , 000 km ##2 ( about 17 % of the total area ) receive an average of 5 mm or less . the annual average rainfall is virtually zero over a wide area of some 1 , 000 , 000 km ##2 in the eastern sahara comprising deserts of libya , egypt and sudan ( ta ##zi ##rb ##u , ku ##fra , da ##kh ##la , k ##har ##ga , far ##af ##ra , si ##wa , as ##yu ##t , so ##ha ##g , lux ##or , as ##wan , abu sim ##bel , wadi half ##a ) where the long - term mean approximate ##s 0 . 5 mm per year . the rainfall is very unreliable and erratic in the sahara as it may vary considerably year by year . in full contrast to the ne ##gli ##gible annual rainfall amounts , the annual rates of potential eva ##por ##ation are extra ##ord ##ina ##rily high , roughly ranging from 2 , 500 mm / year to more than
decay [SEP] rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law , including law makers themselves . in this sense , it stands in contrast to an auto ##cr ##acy , dictatorship , or ol ##iga ##rchy where the rulers are held above the law . lack of the rule of law can be found in both demo ##cr ##acies and dictatorship ##s , for example because of neglect or ignorance of the law , and the rule of law is more apt to decay if a government has insufficient correct ##ive mechanisms for restoring it . government based upon the rule of law is called no ##mo ##cr ##acy .
punishment [SEP] the functional interpretation of the term " rule of law " , consistent with the traditional english meaning , contrasts the " rule of law " with the " rule of man . " according to the functional view , a society in which government officers have a great deal of discretion has a low degree of " rule of law " , whereas a society in which government officers have little discretion has a high degree of " rule of law " . uphold ##ing the rule of law can sometimes require the punishment of those who commit offenses that are just ##if ##iable under natural law but not statutory law . the rule of law is thus somewhat at odds with flexibility , even when flexibility may be prefer ##able .
political reasons [SEP] the language has numerous regional dialects which are generally not mutually intel ##li ##gible . it is employed throughout the tibetan plateau and bhutan and is also spoken in parts of nepal and northern india , such as si ##kki ##m . in general , the dialects of central tibet ( including l ##has ##a ) , k ##ham , am ##do and some smaller nearby areas are considered tibetan dialects . other forms , particularly d ##zong ##kha , si ##kki ##mes ##e , she ##rp ##a , and lad ##akh ##i , are considered by their speakers , largely for political reasons , to be separate languages . however , if the latter group of tibetan - type languages are included in the calculation , then ' greater tibetan ' is spoken by approximately 6 million people across the tibetan plateau . tibetan is also spoken by approximately 150 , 000 exile speakers who have fled from modern - day tibet to india and other countries .
push the invading nepal ##ese out [SEP] for several decades , peace reigned in tibet , but in 1792 the qing qi ##an ##long emperor sent a large chinese army into tibet to push the invading nepal ##ese out . this prompted yet another qing reorganization of the tibetan government , this time through a written plan called the " twenty - nine regulations for better government in tibet " . qing military garrison ##s staffed with qing troops were now also established near the nepal ##ese border . tibet was dominated by the manchu ##s in various stages in the 18th century , and the years immediately following the 1792 regulations were the peak of the qing imperial commissioners ' authority ; but there was no attempt to make tibet a chinese province .
illegal [SEP] after the xi ##nh ##ai revolution ( 1911 – 12 ) toppled the qing dynasty and the last qing troops were escorted out of tibet , the new republic of china apologized for the actions of the qing and offered to restore the dalai lama ' s title . the dalai lama refused any chinese title and declared himself ruler of an independent tibet . in 1913 , tibet and mongolia concluded a treaty of mutual recognition . for the next 36 years , the 13th dalai lama and the regents who succeeded him governed tibet . during this time , tibet fought chinese warlord ##s for control of the ethnic ##ally tibetan areas in xi ##kan ##g and qing ##hai ( parts of k ##ham and am ##do ) along the upper reaches of the yang ##tze river . in 1914 the tibetan government signed the sim ##la accord with britain , ce ##ding the south tibet region to british india . the chinese government denounced the agreement as illegal .
a large appearance fee and at least one guaranteed television appearance [SEP] however , most of the major f ##bs teams annually schedule early season non - conference preseason home games against lesser opponents that are lower - tier f ##bs , football championship , or division ii schools , which often result in lo ##ps ##ided victories in favor of the f ##bs teams and act as exhibition games in all but name , though they additionally provide a large appearance fee and at least one guaranteed television appearance for the smaller school . these games also receive the same criticism as nfl exhibition games , but instead it is targeted to schools scheduling low - quality opponents and the simplicity for a team to run up the score against a weak opponent . however , these games are susceptible to back ##fi ##ring , resulting in damage in poll position and public perception , especially if the higher ranked team loses , although the mere act of scheduling a weak opponent is harmful to a team ' s overall strength of schedule itself . games an f ##bs team schedules against lower division opponents do not count toward the minimum seven wins required for bowl eligibility , and only one game against an fc ##s team can be counted . with the start of the college football playoff system for the 2014 season , major teams are now discouraged from scheduling weaker opponents for their non - conference schedule because of a much higher emphasis on strength of schedule than in the bowl championship series era .
too many other universities had used these colors [SEP] the latin phrase on northwestern ' s seal , qu ##ae ##cum ##que sun ##t vera ( whatsoever things are true ) is drawn from the ep ##istle of paul to the philipp ##ians 4 : 8 , while the greek phrase inscribed on the pages of an open book is taken from the gospel of john 1 : 14 : ο λ ##ο ##γ ##ος π ##λ ##η ##ρ ##ης χ ##α ##ρ ##ι ##τ ##ος κ ##α ##ι α ##λ ##η ##θ ##ε ##ια ##ς ( the word full of grace and truth ) . purple became northwestern ' s official color in 1892 , replacing black and gold after a university committee concluded that too many other universities had used these colors . today , northwestern ' s official color is purple , although white is something of an official color as well , being mentioned in both the university ' s earliest song , alma mater ( 1907 ) ( " hail to purple , hail to white " ) and in many university guidelines .
an arctic cold front [SEP] because of oklahoma ' s position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds , weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively short distances and can change drastically in a short time . as an example , on november 11 , 1911 , the temperature at oklahoma city reached 83 °f ( 28 °c ) in the afternoon ( the record high for that date ) , then an arctic cold front of unprecedented intensity slammed across the state , causing the temperature to crash 66 degrees , down to 17 °f ( − ##8 °c ) at midnight ( the record low for that date ) ; thus , both the record high and record low for november 11 were set on the same date . this type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area , such as the 1912 oklahoma tornado outbreak , when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front , resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour over the course of a day .
hurricane katrina [SEP] the nba ' s new orleans hornets became the first major league sports franchise based in oklahoma when the team was forced to relocate to oklahoma city ' s ford center , now known as chesapeake energy arena , for two seasons following hurricane katrina in 2005 . in july 2008 , the seattle super ##sonic ##s , a franchise owned by the professional basketball club llc , a group of oklahoma city businessmen led by clayton bennett , relocated to oklahoma city and announced that play would begin at the ford center as the oklahoma city thunder for the 2008 – 09 season , becoming the state ' s first permanent major league franchise .
no " official " vote regarding " labor om ##nia vinci ##t " [SEP] state law cod ##ifies oklahoma ' s state emblem ##s and honorary positions ; the oklahoma senate or house of representatives may adopt resolutions design ##ating others for special events and to benefit organizations . currently the state senate is waiting to vote on a change to the state ' s motto . the house passed hc ##r 102 ##4 , which will change the state motto from " labor om ##nia vinci ##t " to " oklahoma - in god we trust ! " the author of the resolution stated that a constituent researched the oklahoma constitution and found no " official " vote regarding " labor om ##nia vinci ##t " , therefore opening the door for an entirely new motto .
extensive settlement [SEP] the me ##sol ##ith ##ic period in the indian subcontinent was followed by the neolithic period , when more extensive settlement of the subcontinent occurred after the end of the last ice age approximately 12 , 000 years ago . the first confirmed semi ##per ##man ##ent settlements appeared 9 , 000 years ago in the b ##him ##bet ##ka rock shelters in modern madhya pradesh , india . early neolithic culture in south asia is represented by the b ##hir ##rana findings ( 750 ##0 bce ) in haryana , india & me ##hr ##garh findings ( 700 ##0 – 900 ##0 bce ) in bal ##och ##istan , pakistan .
collapsed [SEP] from the fifth century to the thirteenth , sr ##au ##ta sacrifices declined , and in ##itia ##tory traditions of buddhism , jain ##ism or more commonly sha ##ivism , va ##ish ##na ##vis ##m and sha ##kti ##sm expanded in royal courts . this period produced some of india ' s finest art , considered the ep ##ito ##me of classical development , and the development of the main spiritual and philosophical systems which continued to be in hinduism , buddhism and jain ##ism . emperor harsh ##a of kan ##na ##uj succeeded in re ##uni ##ting northern india during his reign in the 7th century , after the collapse of the gupta dynasty . his empire collapsed after his death .
brutally suppressed [SEP] the indian rebellion of 1857 was a large - scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the british east india in northern and central india against the company ' s rule . the rebels were di ##sor ##gan ##ized , had differing goals , and were poorly equipped , led , and trained , and had no outside support or funding . they were brutally suppressed and the british government took control of the company and eliminated many of the gr ##ie ##vances that caused it . the government also was determined to keep full control so that no rebellion of such size would ever happen again .
record of anti - government protest [SEP] in 1937 , nasser applied to the royal military academy for army officer training , but his police record of anti - government protest initially blocked his entry . disappointed , he enrolled in the law school at king fu ##ad university , but quit after one semester to re ##app ##ly to the military academy . from his readings , nasser , who frequently spoke of " dignity , glory , and freedom " in his youth , became enchanted with the stories of national li ##ber ##ators and heroic conqueror ##s ; a military career became his chief priority .
to prevent them from falling to pro - nasser forces [SEP] on 14 july , iraqi army officers abd ##el karim q ##asi ##m and abd ##el sal ##am are ##f over ##th ##rew the iraqi monarchy and , the next day , iraqi prime minister and nasser ' s chief arab antagonist , nur ##i al - said , was killed . nasser recognized the new government and stated that " any attack on iraq was tan ##tam ##ount to an attack on the ua ##r " . on 15 july , us marines landed in lebanon , and british special forces in jordan , upon the request of those countries ' governments to prevent them from falling to pro - nasser forces . nasser felt that the revolution in iraq left the road for pan - arab unity un ##block ##ed . on 19 july , for the first time , he declared that he was opt ##ing for full arab union , although he had no plan to merge iraq with the ua ##r . while most members of the iraqi revolutionary command council ( rc ##c ) favored iraqi - ua ##r unity , q ##asi ##m sought to keep iraq independent and resented nasser ' s large popular base in the country .
nervous breakdown [SEP] on 28 september 1961 , secession ##ist army units launched a coup in damascus , declaring syria ' s secession from the ua ##r . in response , pro - union army units in northern syria revolt ##ed and pro - nasser protests occurred in major syrian cities . nasser sent egyptian special forces to la ##ta ##kia to bo ##lster his allies , but withdrew them two days later , citing a refusal to allow inter - arab fighting . addressing the ua ##r ' s breakup on 5 october , nasser accepted personal responsibility and declared that egypt would recognize an elected syrian government . he privately blamed interference by hostile arab governments . according to he ##ika ##l , nasser suffered something resembling a nervous breakdown after the dissolution of the union ; he began to smoke more heavily and his health began to deter ##ior ##ate .
syria ' s ba ' at ##his ##ts purge ##d nasser ' s supporters [SEP] on 8 february 1963 , a military coup in iraq led by a ba ' at ##his ##t – nasser ##ist alliance toppled q ##asi ##m , who was subsequently shot dead . abd ##el sal ##am are ##f , a nasser ##ist , was chosen to be the new president . a similar alliance toppled the syrian government on 8 march . on 14 march , the new iraqi and syrian governments sent nasser delegation ##s to push for a new arab union . at the meeting , nasser lamb ##ast ##ed the ba ' at ##his ##ts for " facilitating " syria ' s split from the ua ##r , and asserted that he was the " leader of the arabs " . a transitional unity agreement st ##ip ##ulating a federal system was signed by the parties on 17 april and the new union was set to be established in may 1965 . however , the agreement fell apart weeks later when syria ' s ba ' at ##his ##ts purge ##d nasser ' s supporters from the officers corps . a failed counter - coup by a nasser ##ist colonel followed , after which nasser condemned the ba ' at ##his ##ts as " fascist ##s " .
am ##er ' s allies in the officers corps threatened to mob ##ili ##ze against him [SEP] following syria ' s secession , nasser grew concerned with am ##er ' s inability to train and modern ##ize the army , and with the state within a state am ##er had created in the military command and intelligence apparatus . in late 1961 , nasser established the presidential council and decreed it the authority to approve all senior military appointments , instead of leaving this responsibility solely to am ##er . moreover , he instructed that the primary criterion for promotion should be merit and not personal loyal ##ties . nasser retracted the initiative after am ##er ' s allies in the officers corps threatened to mob ##ili ##ze against him .
for the con ##clave in rome [SEP] following the death of pope pius xii on 9 october 1958 , ron ##cal ##li watched the live funeral on his last full day in venice on 11 october . his journal was specifically concerned with the funeral and the abused state of the late pont ##iff ' s corpse . ron ##cal ##li left venice for the con ##clave in rome well aware that he was papa ##bil ##e , [ b ] and after eleven ballots , was elected to succeed the late pius xii , so it came as no surprise to him , though he had arrived at the vatican with a return train ticket to venice .

the sole objective of getting john xx ##iii to appear at the window to address them [SEP] on 11 october 1962 , the first session of the second vatican council was held in the vatican . he gave the ga ##ude ##t mater ec ##cles ##ia speech , which served as the opening address for the council . the day was basically elect ##ing members for several council commissions that would work on the issues presented in the council . on that same night following the conclusion of the first session , the people in saint peter ' s square chant ##ed and yelled with the sole objective of getting john xx ##iii to appear at the window to address them .
de ##press ##ants [SEP] psycho ##active drugs can imp ##air the judgment of time . st ##im ##ula ##nts can lead both humans and rats to over ##est ##imate time intervals , while de ##press ##ants can have the opposite effect . the level of activity in the brain of ne ##uro ##tra ##ns ##mit ##ters such as do ##pa ##mine and nor ##ep ##ine ##ph ##rine may be the reason for this . such chemicals will either ex ##cite or inhibit the firing of neurons in the brain , with a greater firing rate allowing the brain to register the occurrence of more events within a given interval ( speed up time ) and a decreased firing rate reducing the brain ' s capacity to distinguish events occurring within a given interval ( slow down time ) .
since the ec ##b was to be located in germany , its president should be french [SEP] the first president of the bank was wi ##m du ##isen ##berg , the former president of the dutch central bank and the european monetary institute . while du ##isen ##berg had been the head of the emi ( taking over from alexandre lam ##fa ##lus ##sy of belgium ) just before the ec ##b came into existence , the french government wanted jean - claude tri ##chet , former head of the french central bank , to be the ec ##b ' s first president . the french argued that since the ec ##b was to be located in germany , its president should be french . this was opposed by the german , dutch and belgian governments who saw du ##isen ##berg as a gu ##aran ##tor of a strong euro . tensions were aba ##ted by a gentleman ' s agreement in which du ##isen ##berg would stand down before the end of his mandate , to be replaced by tri ##chet .

ec ##b veteran who heads its legal department [SEP] jose manuel gonzalez - para ##mo , a spanish member of the executive board since june 2004 , was due to leave the board in early june 2012 and no replacement had been named as of late may 2012 . the spanish had nominated barcelona - born antonio sai ##nz de vic ##una , an ec ##b veteran who heads its legal department , as gonzalez - para ##mo ' s replacement as early as january 2012 but alternatives from luxembourg , finland , and slovenia were put forward and no decision made by may . after a long political battle , luxembourg ' s yves mer ##sch , was appointed as gonzalez - para ##mo ' s replacement .
the representative of the competent authority can be accompanied by a representative from their nc ##b [SEP] the supervisory board meets twice a month to discuss , plan and carry out the ec ##b ’ s supervisory tasks . it proposes draft decisions to the governing council under the non - objection procedure . it is composed of chair ( appointed for a non - renewable term of five years ) , vice - chair ( chosen from among the members of the ec ##b ' s executive board ) four ec ##b representatives and representatives of national supervisors . if the national supervisory authority designated by a member state is not a national central bank ( nc ##b ) , the representative of the competent authority can be accompanied by a representative from their nc ##b . in such cases , the representatives are together considered as one member for the purposes of the voting procedure .
bound by the treaties [SEP] the independence of the ec ##b is instrumental in maintaining price stability . not only must the bank not seek influence , but eu institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ec ##b ' s independence . to offer some accountability , the ec ##b is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the european parliament , the european commission , the council of the european union and the european council . the european parliament also gets to question and then issue its opinion on candidates to the executive board .
pressure on the central bank to come to the aid of those banks [SEP] however , if the debt res ##ched ##ulin ##g causes losses on loans held by european banks , it weaken ##s the private banking system , which then puts pressure on the central bank to come to the aid of those banks . private - sector bond holders are an integral part of the public and private banking system . another possible response is for wealthy member countries to guarantee or purchase the debt of countries that have defaulted or are likely to default . this alternative requires that the tax revenues and credit of the wealthy member countries be used to ref ##ina ##nce the previous borrowing of the weaker member countries , and is politically controversial .
intended to damp ##en international speculation and strengthen portfolio ##s in the private sector and also the central bank [SEP] this changed with the recent sovereign - debt crisis . the ec ##b always could , and through the late summer of 2011 did , purchase bonds issued by the weaker states even though it assumes , in doing so , the risk of a deteriorating balance sheet . ec ##b buying focused primarily on spanish and italian debt . certain techniques can mini ##mise the impact . purchases of italian bonds by the central bank , for example , were intended to damp ##en international speculation and strengthen portfolio ##s in the private sector and also the central bank .
the crisis of 2010 [SEP] the european central bank had stepped up the buying of member nations debt . in response to the crisis of 2010 , some proposals have surfaced for a collective european bond issue that would allow the central bank to purchase a european version of us treasury bills . to make european sovereign debt assets more similar to a us treasury , a collective guarantee of the member states ' solve ##ncy would be necessary . [ b ] but the german government has resisted this proposal , and other analyses indicate that " the sickness of the euro " is due to the link ##age between sovereign debt and failing national banking systems . if the european central bank were to deal directly with failing banking systems sovereign debt would not look as leverage ##d relative to national income in the financially weaker member states .
to stab ##ilis ##e the financial system [SEP] the bank must also co - operate within the eu and internationally with third bodies and entities . finally , it contributes to maintaining a stable financial system and monitoring the banking sector . the latter can be seen , for example , in the bank ' s intervention during the sub ##pr ##ime mortgage crisis when it loaned billions of euros to banks to stab ##ilis ##e the financial system . in december 2007 , the ec ##b decided in conjunction with the federal reserve system under a programme called term auction facility to improve dollar liquid ##ity in the euro ##zone and to stab ##ilis ##e the money market .
easing the debt crisis [SEP] on 21 december 2011 the bank instituted a programme of making low - interest loans with a term of three years ( 36 months ) and 1 % interest to european banks accepting loans from the portfolio of the banks as collateral . loans total ##ling € ##48 ##9 . 2 bn ( us $ 640 bn ) were announced . the loans were not offered to european states , but government securities issued by european states would be acceptable collateral as would mortgage - backed securities and other commercial paper that can be demonstrated to be secure . the programme was announced on 8 december 2011 but observers were surprised by the volume of the loans made when it was implemented . under its lt ##ro it loaned € ##48 ##9 ##bn to 52 ##3 banks for an exceptionally long period of three years at a rate of just one percent . the by far biggest amount of € ##32 ##5 ##bn was tapped by banks in greece , ireland , italy and spain . this way the ec ##b tried to make sure that banks have enough cash to pay off € ##200 ##bn of their own mat ##uring debts in the first three months of 2012 , and at the same time keep operating and loan ##ing to businesses so that a credit crunch does not choke off economic growth . it also hoped that banks would use some of the money to buy government bonds , effectively easing the debt crisis .
age [SEP] in 1933 , von neumann was offered a lifetime professorship on the faculty of the institute for advanced study when the institute ' s plan to appoint hermann we ##yl fell through . he remained a mathematics professor there until his death , although he announced that shortly before his intention to resign and become a professor at large at the university of california . his mother , brothers and in - laws followed john to the united states in 1939 . von neumann ang ##lic ##ized his first name to john , keeping the german - aristocratic surname of von neumann . his brothers changed theirs to " neumann " and " von ##ne ##uman ##n " . von neumann became a naturalized citizen of the united states in 1937 , and immediately tried to become a lieutenant in the united states army ' s officers reserve corps . he passed the exams easily , but was ultimately rejected because of his age . his pre ##war analysis is often quoted . asked about how france would stand up to germany he said " oh , france won ' t matter . "
russell ' s paradox [SEP] the ax ##iom ##ati ##zation of mathematics , on the model of eu ##cl ##id ' s elements , had reached new levels of rig ##our and breadth at the end of the 19th century , particularly in arithmetic , thanks to the ax ##iom sc ##hema of richard de ##dek ##ind and charles sanders pei ##rce , and geometry , thanks to david hilbert . at the beginning of the 20th century , efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a set ##back due to russell ' s paradox ( on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves ) . the problem of an adequate ax ##iom ##ati ##zation of set theory was resolved implicit ##ly about twenty years later by ernst ze ##rm ##elo and abraham fra ##en ##kel . ze ##rm ##elo – fra ##en ##kel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics . but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself . in his doctoral thesis of 1925 , von neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets — the ax ##iom of foundation and the notion of class .
felt that , if freedom and civilization were to survive , it would have to be because the us would triumph over total ##itarian ##ism [SEP] von neumann entered government service ( manhattan project ) primarily because he felt that , if freedom and civilization were to survive , it would have to be because the us would triumph over total ##itarian ##ism from nazis ##m , fascism and soviet communism . during a senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as " violently anti - communist , and much more mil ##ita ##rist ##ic than the norm " . he was quoted in 1950 remark ##ing , " if you say why not bomb [ the soviets ] tomorrow , i say , why not today ? if you say today at five o ' clock , i say why not one o ' clock ? "
two bills of the same title had originated from the house [SEP] in australia , a technical issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001 . in 1976 , a bill originating in the house of representatives was mistakenly submitted to the governor - general and assent ##ed to . however , it was later discovered that it had not been passed by each house . the error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the house . the governor - general revoked the first assent , before assent ##ing to the bill which had actually passed . the same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001 .
committing adultery [SEP] a new device for granting assent was created during the reign of king henry viii . in 154 ##2 , henry sought to execute his fifth wife , catherine howard , whom he accused of committing adultery ; the execution was to be authorised not after a trial but by a bill of attain ##der , to which he would have to personally assent after listening to the entire text . henry decided that " the repetition of so gr ##ie ##vo ##us a story and the recital of so infamous a crime " in his presence " might re ##open a wound already closing in the royal bo ##som " . therefore , parliament inserted a clause into the act of attain ##der , providing that assent granted by commissioners " is and ever was and ever shall be , as good " as assent granted by the sovereign personally . the procedure was used only five times during the 16th century , but more often during the 17th and 18th centuries , especially when george iii ' s health began to deter ##ior ##ate . queen victoria became the last monarch to personally grant assent in 1854 .
85 years after his great - grandmother , queen victoria , had last granted royal assent personally [SEP] in canada , the traditional ceremony for granting assent in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century , long after it had been discontinued in the united kingdom and other commonwealth realms . one result , conceived as part of a string of royal duties intended to demonstrate canada ' s status as an independent kingdom , was that king george vi personally assent ##ed to nine bills of the canadian parliament during the 1939 royal tour of canada — 85 years after his great - grandmother , queen victoria , had last granted royal assent personally in the united kingdom . under the royal assent act 2002 , however , the alternative practice of granting assent in writing , with each house being notified separately ( the speaker of the senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of royal assent ) , was brought into force . as the act also provides , royal assent is to be sign ##ified — by the governor general , or , more often , by a deputy , usually a justice of the supreme court , at least twice each calendar year : for the first app ##ropriation measure and for at least one other act , usually the first non - app ##ropriation measure passed . however , the act provides that a grant of royal assent is not rendered invalid by a failure to employ the traditional ceremony where required .
, it becomes law without his signature [SEP] the constitution of jordan grants its monarch the right to with ##hold assent to laws passed by its parliament . article 93 of that document gives the jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent to him from the national assembly ; if he veto ##es it within that time ##frame , the assembly may over ##ride his veto by a two - thirds vote of both houses ; otherwise , the law does not go into effect ( but it may be rec ##ons ##ider ##ed in the next session of the assembly ) . if the monarch fails to act within six months of the bill being presented to him , it becomes law without his signature .
neither the monarch nor a minister will sign the bill , not ##ifying the states general that " the king will keep the proposal under advise ##ment . " [SEP] the government , consisting of the monarch and the ministers , will then usually approve the proposal and the sovereign and one of the ministers signs the proposal with the addition of an en ##act ##ing clause , thereafter not ##ifying the states general that " the king assent ##s to the proposal . " it has happened in exceptional circumstances that the government does not approve a law that has been passed in parliament . in such a case , neither the monarch nor a minister will sign the bill , not ##ifying the states general that " the king will keep the proposal under advise ##ment . " a law that has received royal assent will be published in the state magazine , with the original being kept in the archives of the king ' s offices .
dish ##ear ##ten ##ed with the french political system [SEP] in september 1940 , during the second world war , pro - gaul ##list french officers took control of u ##bang ##i - sha ##ri and general le ##cle ##rc established his headquarters for the free french forces in bang ##ui . in 1946 bart ##hel ##emy bog ##anda was elected with 9 , 000 votes to the french national assembly , becoming the first representative for car in the french government . bog ##anda maintained a political stance against racism and the colonial regime but gradually became dish ##ear ##ten ##ed with the french political system and returned to car to establish the movement for the social evolution of black africa ( mesa ##n ) in 1950 .
young students protested against bo ##kas ##sa ' s decree [SEP] in april 1979 , young students protested against bo ##kas ##sa ' s decree that all school attendees would need to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives . the government violently suppressed the protests , killing 100 children and teenagers . bo ##kas ##sa himself may have been personally involved in some of the killings . in september 1979 , france over ##th ##rew bo ##kas ##sa and " restored " da ##cko to power ( subsequently restoring the name of the country to the central african republic ) . da ##cko , in turn , was again overthrow ##n in a coup by general andre ko ##ling ##ba on 1 september 1981 .
when fighting broke out between rebel and government forces [SEP] there are many missionary groups operating in the country , including lutheran ##s , baptist ##s , catholics , grace brethren , and je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses . while these missionaries are predominantly from the united states , france , italy , and spain , many are also from nigeria , the democratic republic of the congo , and other african countries . large numbers of missionaries left the country when fighting broke out between rebel and government forces in 2002 – 3 , but many of them have now returned to continue their work .
intra ##ven ##ous co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids , magnesium sulfate , and hospital ##ization may be required [SEP] there is no cure for asthma . symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers , such as all ##er ##gens and ir ##ritan ##ts , and by the use of inhaled co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids . long - acting beta ago ##nist ##s ( lab ##a ) or anti ##le ##uk ##ot ##rien ##e agents may be used in addition to inhaled co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids if asthma symptoms remain un ##con ##tro ##lled . treatment of rapidly worse ##ning symptoms is usually with an inhaled short - acting beta - 2 ago ##nist such as sal ##bu ##tam ##ol and co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids taken by mouth . in very severe cases , intra ##ven ##ous co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids , magnesium sulfate , and hospital ##ization may be required .
low air quality from factors such as traffic pollution or high ozone levels [SEP] many environmental factors have been associated with asthma ' s development and ex ##ace ##rba ##tion including all ##er ##gens , air pollution , and other environmental chemicals . smoking during pregnancy and after delivery is associated with a greater risk of asthma - like symptoms . low air quality from factors such as traffic pollution or high ozone levels , has been associated with both asthma development and increased asthma severity . exposure to indoor volatile organic compounds may be a trigger for asthma ; formal ##deh ##yde exposure , for example , has a positive association . also , ph ##thal ##ates in certain types of pv ##c are associated with asthma in children and adults .
it is the single best test for asthma [SEP] sp ##iro ##metry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management . it is the single best test for asthma . if the fe ##v ##1 measured by this technique improves more than 12 % following administration of a bro ##nch ##od ##ila ##tor such as sal ##bu ##tam ##ol , this is supportive of the diagnosis . it however may be normal in those with a history of mild asthma , not currently acting up . as caf ##fe ##ine is a bro ##nch ##od ##ila ##tor in people with asthma , the use of caf ##fe ##ine before a lung function test may interfere with the results . single - breath di ##ff ##using capacity can help differentiate asthma from cop ##d . it is reasonable to perform sp ##iro ##metry every one or two years to follow how well a person ' s asthma is controlled .
due to cop ##d and asthma sharing similar principles of management [SEP] chronic ob ##st ##ru ##ctive pulmonary disease can coe ##xi ##st with asthma and can occur as a com ##plication of chronic asthma . after the age of 65 most people with ob ##st ##ru ##ctive air ##way disease will have asthma and cop ##d . in this setting , cop ##d can be differentiated by increased air ##way ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s , abnormal ##ly increased wall thickness , and increased smooth muscle in the bro ##nch ##i . however , this level of investigation is not performed due to cop ##d and asthma sharing similar principles of management : co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids , long acting beta ago ##nist ##s , and smoking ce ##ssa ##tion . it closely resembles asthma in symptoms , is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke , an older age , less sy ##mpt ##om rev ##ers ##ibility after bro ##nch ##od ##ila ##tor administration , and decreased likelihood of family history of atop ##y .
effective in decreasing ex ##ace ##rba ##tions of asthma [SEP] the evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak . some show promise including : limiting smoke exposure both in ut ##ero and after delivery , breast ##fe ##eding , and increased exposure to day ##care or large families but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication . early pet exposure may be useful . results from exposure to pets at other times are inc ##on ##clusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet . dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended . reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective . it is not clear if annual influenza va ##cci ##nation ##s effects the risk of ex ##ace ##rba ##tions . im ##mun ##ization ; however , is recommended by the world health organization . smoking ban ##s are effective in decreasing ex ##ace ##rba ##tions of asthma .
the reason for these differences is not well known [SEP] as of 2011 , 235 – 330 million people worldwide are affected by asthma , and approximately 250 , 000 – 345 , 000 people die per year from the disease . rates vary between countries with prevalence ##s between 1 and 18 % . it is more common in developed than developing countries . one thus sees lower rates in asia , eastern europe and africa . within developed countries it is more common in those who are economically disadvantaged while in contrast in developing countries it is more common in the affluent . the reason for these differences is not well known . low and middle income countries make up more than 80 % of the mortality .
due to the length of the title and the desire to keep the film on one disc [SEP] as pioneer introduced digital audio to laser ##dis ##c in 1985 , they further refined the ca ##a format . ca ##a ##55 was introduced in 1985 with a total playback capacity per side of 55 minutes 5 seconds , reducing the video capacity to resolve bandwidth issues with the inclusion of digital audio . several titles released between 1985 and 1987 were analog audio only due to the length of the title and the desire to keep the film on one disc ( e . g . , back to the future ) . by 1987 , pioneer had overcome the technical challenges and was able to once again en ##code in ca ##a ##60 , allowing a total of 60 minutes 5 seconds . pioneer further refined ca ##a , offering ca ##a ##45 , encoding 45 minutes of material , but filling the entire playback surface of the side . used on only a handful of titles , ca ##a ##65 offered 65 minutes 5 seconds of playback time per side . there are a handful of titles pressed by tech ##ni ##dis ##c that used ca ##a ##50 . the final variant of ca ##a is ca ##a ##70 , which could accommodate 70 minutes of playback time per side . there are not any known uses of this format on the consumer market .
garbage ( static ) output [SEP] both ac - 3 and dt ##s surround audio were cl ##ums ##ily implemented on laser ##dis ##cs , leading to some interesting player - and disc - dependent issues . a disc that included ac - 3 audio for ##feit ##ed the right analog audio channel to the mod ##ulated ac - 3 rf stream . if the player did not have an ac - 3 output available , the next most attractive playback option would be the digital do ##lby surround or stereo audio tracks . the reason for this is the rf signal needs to bypass the audio circuit ##ry in order to be properly processed by the demo ##du ##lat ##or . if either the player did not support digital audio tracks ( common in older players ) , or the disc did not include digital audio tracks at all ( uncommon for a disc which is mastered with an ac - 3 track ) , the only remaining option was to fall back to a mono ##phonic presentation of the left analog audio track . however , many older analog - only players not only failed to output ac - 3 streams correctly , but were not even aware of their potential existence . such a player will happily play the analog audio tracks verb ##ati ##m , resulting in garbage ( static ) output in the right channel .
progressive wear with each use [SEP] laser ##dis ##cs potentially had a much longer lifespan than video ##cas ##sett ##es . because the discs were read optical ##ly instead of magnetic ##ally , no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc , except for the player ' s cl ##amp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read . as a result , playback would not wear the information - bearing part of the discs , and properly manufactured lds would theoretically last beyond one ' s lifetime . by contrast , a vhs tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum , causing progressive wear with each use ( though later in vhs ' s lifespan , engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact ) . also , the tape was thin and delicate , and it was easy for a player mechanism , especially on a low quality or mal ##fu ##nction ##ing model , to mis ##hand ##le the tape and damage it by cr ##ea ##sing it , fr ##ill ##ing ( stretching ) its edges , or even breaking it .
the rotational speed never varies [SEP] assuming the player ' s optical pickup is in proper working order , cross ##talk distortion normally does not occur during playback of ca ##v format laser ##dis ##cs , as the rotational speed never varies . however , if the player cal ##ib ##ration is out of order or if the ca ##v disc is faulty or damaged , other problems affecting tracking accuracy can occur . one such problem is " laser lock " , where the player reads the same two fields for a given frame over and over again , causing the picture to look frozen as if the movie were paused .
the player reads the same two fields for a given frame over and over again , causing the picture to look frozen [SEP] assuming the player ' s optical pickup is in proper working order , cross ##talk distortion normally does not occur during playback of ca ##v format laser ##dis ##cs , as the rotational speed never varies . however , if the player cal ##ib ##ration is out of order or if the ca ##v disc is faulty or damaged , other problems affecting tracking accuracy can occur . one such problem is " laser lock " , where the player reads the same two fields for a given frame over and over again , causing the picture to look frozen as if the movie were paused .
prices were kept low to ensure adoption [SEP] laser ##dis ##c did not have high market penetration in north america due to the high cost of the players and discs , which were far more expensive than vhs players and tapes , and due to marketplace confusion with the technological ##ly inferior ce ##d , which also went by the name video ##dis ##c . while the format was not widely adopted by north american consumers , it was well received among video ##phile ##s due to the superior audio and video quality compared to vhs and beta ##max tapes , finding a place in nearly one million american homes by the end of 1990 . the format was more popular in japan than in north america because prices were kept low to ensure adoption , resulting in minimal price differences between vhs tapes and the higher quality laser ##dis ##cs , helping ensure that it quickly became the dominant consumer video format in japan . anime collectors in every country the ld format was released , which includes both north america and japan , also quickly became familiar with this format , and sought the higher video and sound quality of laser ##dis ##c and the availability of numerous titles not available on vhs . laser ##dis ##cs were also popular alternatives to video ##cas ##sett ##es among movie enthusiasts in the more affluent regions of south east asia , such as singapore , due to their high integration with the japanese export market and the disc - based media ' s superior longevity compared to video ##cas ##sett ##e , especially in the humid conditions endemic to that area of the world .
very few people owned 16 : 9 displays [SEP] with the release of 16 : 9 television ##s in the mid - 1990s , pioneer and to ##shi ##ba decided that it was time to take advantage of this aspect ratio . squeeze lds were enhanced 16 : 9 - ratio wide ##screen laser ##dis ##cs . during the video transfer stage , the movie was stored in an ana ##morphic " squeezed " format . the wide ##screen movie image was stretched to fill the entire video frame with less or none of the video resolution wasted to create letter ##box bars . the advantage was a 33 % greater vertical resolution compared to letter ##box ##ed wide ##screen laser ##dis ##c . this same procedure was used for ana ##morphic dvds , but unlike all dvd players , very few ld players had the ability to un ##sque ##ez ##e the image for 4 : 3 sets , and very few if any 4 : 3 sets could be set to play them properly either . if the discs were played on a standard 4 : 3 television the image would be distorted . since very few people owned 16 : 9 displays , the market ##ability of these special discs was very limited .
to make it record ##able , as opposed to the silver mirror appearance of regular lds [SEP] the only cosmetic difference between an r ##l ##v disc and a regular factory - pressed laser ##dis ##cs is their reflective purple - violet ( or blue with some r ##l ##v discs ) color resulting from the dye embedded in the reflective layer of the disc to make it record ##able , as opposed to the silver mirror appearance of regular lds . the pu ##rp ##lish color of r ##l ##vs is very similar to dvd - r and dvd + r discs . r ##l ##vs were popular for making short - run quantities of laser ##dis ##cs for specialized applications such as interactive ki ##os ##ks and flight simulator ##s .
his st ##am ##mer [SEP] because of his st ##am ##mer , albert dread ##ed public speaking . after his closing speech at the british empire exhibition at wembley on 31 october 1925 , one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners , he began to see lionel log ##ue , an australian - born speech therapist . the duke and log ##ue practised breathing exercises , and the duchess re ##hear ##sed with him patiently . subsequently , he was able to speak with less hesitation . with his delivery improved , the duke opened the new parliament house in canberra , australia , during a tour of the empire in 1927 . his journey by sea to australia , new zealand and fiji took him via jamaica , where albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man , which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races .
edward was unmarried and had no children [SEP] as edward was unmarried and had no children , albert was the heir pre ##sum ##ptive to the throne . less than a year later , on 11 december 1936 , edward viii abd ##icated in order to marry his mistress , wallis simpson , who was divorced from her first husband and di ##vor ##cing her second . edward had been advised by british prime minister stanley baldwin that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex - husbands . edward chose abd ##ication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans . thus albert became king , a position he was reluctant to accept . the day before the abd ##ication , he went to london to see his mother , queen mary . he wrote in his diary , " when i told her what had happened , i broke down and sobbed like a child .

nation - state of australia officially came into existence as a federation [SEP] on the 1st of january 1901 the nation - state of australia officially came into existence as a federation . the australian continent was colon ##ised by the united kingdom in 1788 , which subsequently established six , eventually self - governing , colonies there . in the 1890s the governments of these colonies all held referendum ##s on becoming a unified , self - governing " commonwealth " within the british empire . when all the colonies voted in favour of federation , the federation of australia commenced , resulting in the establishment of the commonwealth of australia in 1901 . the model of australian federal ##ism adhere ##s closely to the original model of the united states of america , although it does so through a parliamentary westminster system rather than a presidential system .
the central government ( through its appointed governor ) takes control of state ' s administration for certain months [SEP] a distinguishing aspect of indian federal ##ism is that unlike many other forms of federal ##ism , it is as ##ym ##metric . article 370 makes special provisions for the state of jammu and kashmir as per its instrument of accession . article 37 ##1 makes special provisions for the states of andhra pradesh , arun ##achal pradesh , assam , goa , mi ##zo ##ram , mani ##pur , naga ##land and si ##kki ##m as per their accession or state - hood deals . also one more aspect of indian federal ##ism is system of president ' s rule in which the central government ( through its appointed governor ) takes control of state ' s administration for certain months when no party can form a government in the state or there is violent disturbance in the state .
changed towards a generally autonomous model [SEP] the post - imperial nature of russian subdivision of government changed towards a generally autonomous model which began with the establishment of the ussr ( of which russia was governed as part ) . it was liberal ##ized in the aftermath of the soviet union , with the reforms under boris ye ##lts ##in preserving much of the soviet structure while applying increasingly liberal reforms to the governance of the constituent republics and subjects ( while also coming into conflict with che ##chen secession ##ist rebels during the che ##chen war ) . some of the reforms under ye ##lts ##in were scaled back by vladimir putin .
james madison asserted that the states and national government [SEP] federal ##ism in the united states is the evolving relationship between state governments and the federal government of the united states . american government has evolved from a system of dual federal ##ism to one of ass ##oc ##ia ##tive federal ##ism . in " federal ##ist no . 46 , " james madison asserted that the states and national government " are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people , constituted with different powers . " alexander hamilton , writing in " federal ##ist no . 28 , " suggested that both levels of government would exercise authority to the citizens ' benefit : " if their [ the peoples ' ] rights are invaded by either , they can make use of the other as the instrument of red ##ress . " ( 1 )

because the states were pre ##ex ##ist ##ing political entities [SEP] because the states were pre ##ex ##ist ##ing political entities , the u . s . constitution did not need to define or explain federal ##ism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to the federal government . the federal government has certain express powers ( also called en ##ume ##rated powers ) which are powers spelled out in the constitution , including the right to levy taxes , declare war , and regulate interstate and foreign commerce . in addition , the necessary and proper clause gives the federal government the implied power to pass any law " necessary and proper " for the execution of its express powers . other powers — the reserved powers — are reserved to the people or the states . the power delegate ##d to the federal government was significantly expanded by the supreme court decision in mcc ##ull ##och v . maryland ( 1819 ) , amendments to the constitution following the civil war , and by some later amendments — as well as the overall claim of the civil war , that the states were legally subject to the final di ##cta ##tes of the federal government .
the u . s . supreme court did not invalid ##ate any federal statute as exceeding congress ' power under the commerce clause . [SEP] from 1938 until 1995 , the u . s . supreme court did not invalid ##ate any federal statute as exceeding congress ' power under the commerce clause . most actions by the federal government can find some legal support among the express powers , such as the commerce clause , whose app ##lica ##bility has been narrowed by the supreme court in recent years . in 1995 the supreme court rejected the gun - free school zones act in the lopez decision , and also rejected the civil remedy portion of the violence against women act of 1994 in the united states v . morrison decision . recently , the commerce clause was interpreted to include marijuana laws in the gonzales v . rai ##ch decision .
consequently has a number of political issues [SEP] on one hand , this means that the belgian political landscape , generally speaking , consists of only two components : the dutch - speaking population represented by dutch - language political parties , and the majority populations of wall ##onia and brussels , represented by their french - speaking parties . the brussels region emerges as a third component . this specific dual form of federal ##ism , with the special position of brussels , consequently has a number of political issues — even minor ones — that are being fought out over the dutch / french - language political division . with such issues , a final decision is possible only in the form of a compromise . this tendency gives this dual federal ##ism model a number of traits that generally are ascribed to con ##fed ##eral ##ism , and makes the future of belgian federal ##ism contentious .
cannot occur without the unanimous consent of all states or of a particular state [SEP] some federal constitution ##s also provide that certain constitutional amendments cannot occur without the unanimous consent of all states or of a particular state . the us constitution provides that no state may be deprived of equal representation in the senate without its consent . in australia , if a proposed amendment will specifically impact one or more states , then it must be endorsed in the referendum held in each of those states . any amendment to the canadian constitution that would modify the role of the monarchy would require unanimous consent of the provinces . the german basic law provides that no amendment is ad ##missible at all that would ab ##olis ##h the federal system .
because the 1988 constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation trip ##art ##ite [SEP] usually , a federation is formed at two levels : the central government and the regions ( states , provinces , territories ) , and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities . brazil is an exception , because the 1988 constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation trip ##art ##ite , encompassing the union , the states , and the municipalities . each state is divided into municipalities ( mu ##nic ##ip ##ios ) with their own legislative council ( cam ##ara de ve ##rea ##dor ##es ) and a mayor ( pre ##feit ##o ) , which are partly autonomous from both federal and state government . each municipality has a " little constitution " , called " organic law " ( lei organic ##a ) . mexico is an intermediate case , in that municipalities are granted full - autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities ( mu ##nic ##ip ##io libre , " free municipality " ) is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states ' constitution ##s . moreover , the federal constitution determines which powers and compete ##ncies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states . however , municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly .
chinese government is far too un ##wi ##eld ##y to effectively and e ##qui ##ta ##bly manage the country ' s affairs [SEP] china is the largest unitary state in the world by both population and land area . although china has had long periods of central rule for centuries , it is often argued that the unitary structure of the chinese government is far too un ##wi ##eld ##y to effectively and e ##qui ##ta ##bly manage the country ' s affairs . on the other hand , chinese nationalists are suspicious of decent ##ral ##ization as a form of secession ##ism and a back ##door for national di ##sun ##ity ; still others argue that the degree of autonomy given to provincial - level officials in the people ' s republic of china amounts to a de facto federal ##ism .
referendum ##s in scotland and wales and the good friday agreement in northern ireland [SEP] in modern times , a process of dev ##ol ##ution in the united kingdom has decent ##ral ##ised power once again . since the 1997 referendum ##s in scotland and wales and the good friday agreement in northern ireland , three of the four constituent countries of the uk now have some level of autonomy . government has been dev ##olved to the scottish parliament , the national assembly for wales and the northern ireland assembly . england does not have its own parliament and english affairs continue to be decided by the westminster parliament . in 1998 a set of eight une ##le ##cted regional assemblies , or chambers , was created to support the english regional development agencies , but these were abolished between 2008 and 2010 . the regions of england continue to be used in certain governmental administrative functions .
the local church is ruled by elected elders , some of which are ministerial . [SEP] federal ##ism also finds expression in ec ##cles ##iology ( the doctrine of the church ) . for example , presbyterian church governance resembles parliamentary republican ##ism ( a form of political federal ##ism ) to a large extent . in presbyterian denominations , the local church is ruled by elected elders , some of which are ministerial . each church then sends representatives or commissioners to pre ##sby ##ter ##ies and further to a general assembly . each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members . in this governmental structure , each component has some level of sovereignty over itself . as in political federal ##ism , in presbyterian ec ##cles ##iology there is shared sovereignty .
the apostles and elders gathered together to govern the church [SEP] some christians argue that the earliest source of political federal ##ism ( or federal ##ism in human institutions ; in contrast to theological federal ##ism ) is the ecclesiastical federal ##ism found in the bible . they point to the structure of the early christian church as described ( and prescribed , as believed by many ) in the new testament . in their arguments , this is particularly demonstrated in the council of jerusalem , described in acts chapter 15 , where the apostles and elders gathered together to govern the church ; the apostles being representatives of the universal church , and elders being such for the local church . to this day , elements of federal ##ism can be found in almost every christian denomination , some more than others .
they have been over - harvested [SEP] earth ##worm ##s are ol ##igo ##cha ##ete ##s that support terrestrial food chains both as prey and in some regions are important in ae ##ration and en ##rich ##ing of soil . the burr ##owing of marine poly ##cha ##ete ##s , which may constitute up to a third of all species in near - shore environments , encourages the development of ecosystems by enabling water and oxygen to penetrate the sea floor . in addition to improving soil fertility , anne ##lid ##s serve humans as food and as bait . scientists observe anne ##lid ##s to monitor the quality of marine and fresh water . although blood - letting is no longer in favor with doctors , some lee ##ch species are regarded as endangered species because they have been over - harvested for this purpose in the last few centuries . rag ##worm ##s ' jaws are now being studied by engineers as they offer an exceptional combination of light ##ness and strength .
anne ##lid ##s are soft - bodied [SEP] since anne ##lid ##s are soft - bodied , their fossils are rare – mostly jaws and the mineral ##ized tubes that some of the species secret ##ed . although some late ed ##iac ##aran fossils may represent anne ##lid ##s , the oldest known fossil that is identified with confidence comes from about 51 ##8 million years ago in the early cambrian period . fossils of most modern mobile poly ##cha ##ete groups appeared by the end of the carbon ##iferous , about 299 million years ago . pal ##ae ##ont ##ologists disagree about whether some body fossils from the mid or ##do ##vic ##ian , about 47 ##2 to 46 ##1 million years ago , are the remains of ol ##igo ##cha ##ete ##s , and the earliest ind ##is ##put ##able fossils of the group appear in the tertiary period , which began 65 million years ago .
the sept ##a enable the circular and longitudinal muscles to change the shape of individual segments [SEP] many anne ##lid ##s move by per ##ista ##ls ##is ( waves of contraction and expansion that sweep along the body ) , or flex the body while using para ##pod ##ia to crawl or swim . in these animals the sept ##a enable the circular and longitudinal muscles to change the shape of individual segments , by making each segment a separate fluid - filled " balloon " . however , the sept ##a are often incomplete in anne ##lid ##s that are semi - se ##ssi ##le or that do not move by per ##ista ##ls ##is or by movements of para ##pod ##ia – for example some move by whipping movements of the body , some small marine species move by means of ci ##lia ( fine muscle - powered hairs ) and some burr ##ower ##s turn their ph ##ary ##nge ##s ( throat ##s ) inside out to penetrate the sea - floor and drag themselves into it .
god ' s responsibility for evil and suffering in the world [SEP] the ##ism generally holds that god exists realistic ##ally , objective ##ly , and independently of human thought ; that god created and sustain ##s everything ; that god is om ##ni ##pot ##ent and eternal ; and that god is personal and interacting with the universe through , for example , religious experience and the prayers of humans . the ##ism holds that god is both trans ##cend ##ent and im ##man ##ent ; thus , god is simultaneously infinite and in some way present in the affairs of the world . not all the ##ists sub ##scribe to all of these proposition ##s , but each usually sub ##scribe ##s to some of them ( see , by way of comparison , family resemblance ) . catholic theology holds that god is infinitely simple and is not in ##vo ##lun ##tar ##ily subject to time . most the ##ists hold that god is om ##ni ##pot ##ent , om ##nis ##cie ##nt , and benevolent , although this belief raises questions about god ' s responsibility for evil and suffering in the world . some the ##ists as ##cr ##ibe to god a self - conscious or purpose ##ful limiting of om ##ni ##pot ##ence , om ##nis ##cie ##nce , or ben ##ev ##ole ##nce . open the ##ism , by contrast , asserts that , due to the nature of time , god ' s om ##nis ##cie ##nce does not mean the deity can predict the future . the ##ism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods , i . e . , mono ##the ##ism or poly ##the ##ism .
it makes those aspects more familiar [SEP] pascal boyer argues that while there is a wide array of supernatural concepts found around the world , in general , supernatural beings tend to behave much like people . the construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known traits of religion . he cites examples from greek mythology , which is , in his opinion , more like a modern soap opera than other religious systems . bertrand du caste ##l and timothy jurgen ##sen demonstrate through formal ##ization that boyer ' s ex ##pl ##ana ##tory model matches physics ' ep ##iste ##mology in po ##sit ##ing not directly ob ##ser ##vable entities as inter ##media ##ries . anthropologist stewart guthrie contend ##s that people project human features onto non - human aspects of the world because it makes those aspects more familiar . si ##gm ##und freud also suggested that god concepts are projections of one ' s father .
a means of enforcing morality [SEP] likewise , emile du ##rk ##heim was one of the earliest to suggest that gods represent an extension of human social life to include supernatural beings . in line with this reasoning , psychologist matt ross ##ano contend ##s that when humans began living in larger groups , they may have created gods as a means of enforcing morality . in small groups , morality can be enforced by social forces such as gossip or reputation . however , it is much harder to enforce morality using social forces in much larger groups . ross ##ano indicates that by including ever - watch ##ful gods and spirits , humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfish ##ness and building more cooperative groups .
to avoid breach ##ing sovereignty through military invasion [SEP] the use of drones by the central intelligence agency in pakistan to carry out operations associated with the global war on terror sparks debate over sovereignty and the laws of war . the u . s . government uses the cia rather than the u . s . air force for strikes in pakistan in order to avoid breach ##ing sovereignty through military invasion . the united states was criticized by [ according to whom ? ] a report on drone warfare and aerial sovereignty for abu ##sing the term ' global war on terror ' to carry out military operations through government agencies without formally declaring war .
he and his supporters were promptly expelled [SEP] as the economic situation worsened macdonald agreed to form a " national government " with the conservatives and the liberals . on 24 august 1931 macdonald submitted the resignation of his ministers and led a small number of his senior colleagues in forming the national government together with the other parties . this caused great anger among those within the labour party who felt betrayed by macdonald ' s actions : he and his supporters were promptly expelled from the labour party and formed a separate national labour organisation . the remaining labour party mps ( led again by arthur henderson ) and a few liberals went into opposition . the ensuing 1931 general election resulted in overwhelming victory for the national government and disaster for the labour party which won only 52 seats , 225 fewer than in 1929 .
higher pay [SEP] call ##aghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978 when most opinion polls showed labour to have a narrow lead . however he decided to extend his wage restraint policy for another year hoping that the economy would be in a better shape for a 1979 election . but during the winter of 1978 – 79 there were widespread strikes among lo ##rry drivers , railway workers , car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay - rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life . these events came to be dubbed the " winter of discontent " .
widen the voting franchise [SEP] after its defeat in the 1979 general election the labour party underwent a period of internal rivalry between the left represented by tony ben ##n , and the right represented by denis heal ##ey . the election of michael foot as leader in 1980 , and the leftist policies he es ##po ##used , such as un ##ila ##tera ##l nuclear di ##sar ##mament , leaving the european economic community ( ee ##c ) and nato , closer governmental influence in the banking system , the creation of a national minimum wage and a ban on fox hunting led in 1981 to four former cabinet ministers from the right of the labour party ( shirley williams , william rodgers , roy jenkins and david owen ) forming the social democratic party . ben ##n was only narrowly defeated by heal ##ey in a bitterly fought deputy leadership election in 1981 after the introduction of an electoral college intended to widen the voting franchise to elect the leader and their deputy . by 1982 , the national executive committee had concluded that the entry ##ist militant tendency group were in contra ##vent ##ion of the party ' s constitution . the militant newspaper ' s five member editorial board were expelled on 22 february 1983 .
the iraq war [SEP] a perceived turning point was when blair controversial ##ly allied himself with us president george w . bush in supporting the iraq war , which caused him to lose much of his political support . the un secretary - general , among many , considered the war illegal . the iraq war was deeply unpopular in most western countries , with western governments divided in their support and under pressure from worldwide popular protests . the decisions that led up to the iraq war and its subsequent conduct are currently the subject of sir john chi ##lco ##t ' s iraq inquiry .
low ( less than 50 ##¢ / gal ) fuel prices , long distances and low population [SEP] alaska ' s economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating , transportation , electric power and light . though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and under ##dev ##elo ##ped , proposals for statewide energy systems ( e . g . with special low - cost electric inter ##ties ) were judged une ##con ##omic ##al ( at the time of the report , 2001 ) due to low ( less than 50 ##¢ / gal ) fuel prices , long distances and low population . the cost of a gallon of gas in urban alaska today is usually 30 – 60 ##¢ higher than the national average ; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs , seasonal usage peaks , nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors .
to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil [SEP] the alaska permanent fund is a constitutional ##ly authorized app ##ropriation of oil revenues , established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil , largely in anticipation of the recently constructed trans - alaska pipeline system . the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 1969 pr ##ud ##hoe bay lease sale , out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to $ 900 million ) at once . it was later championed by governor jay hammond and ken ##ai state representative hugh malone . it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since , divert ##ing revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund .
fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to $ 900 million ) at once [SEP] the alaska permanent fund is a constitutional ##ly authorized app ##ropriation of oil revenues , established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil , largely in anticipation of the recently constructed trans - alaska pipeline system . the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 1969 pr ##ud ##hoe bay lease sale , out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to $ 900 million ) at once . it was later championed by governor jay hammond and ken ##ai state representative hugh malone . it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since , divert ##ing revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund .
political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation [SEP] the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage de ##dic ##ating state funds for a particular purpose . the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this , mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation . from its initial principal of $ 73 ##4 , 000 , the fund has grown to $ 50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs . most if not all the principal is invested conservative ##ly outside alaska . this has led to frequent calls by alaska ##n politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska , though such a stance has never gained momentum .
shipping costs [SEP] most food in alaska is transported into the state from " outside " , and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive . in rural areas , subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibit ##ively expensive . though most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline , the cost of import ##ing food to remote villages can be high , because of the terrain and difficult road conditions , which change dramatically , due to varying climate and precipitation changes . the cost of transport can reach as high as 50 ##¢ per pound ( $ 1 . 10 / kg ) or more in some remote areas , during the most difficult times , if these locations can be reached at all during such inc ##lem ##ent weather and terrain conditions . the cost of delivering a 1 us gallon ( 3 . 8 l ) of milk is about $ 3 . 50 in many villages where per capita income can be $ 20 , 000 or less . fuel cost per gallon is routinely 20 – 30 ##¢ higher than the continental united states average , with only hawaii having higher prices .
june ##au , is not accessible by road [SEP] alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the u . s . the state ' s road system covers a relatively small area of the state , linking the central population centers and the alaska highway , the principal route out of the state through canada . the state capital , june ##au , is not accessible by road , only a car ferry , which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system , or building a road connection from hai ##nes . the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska .
all other means of transportation had failed [SEP] another alaska ##n transportation method is the dogs ##led . in modern times ( that is , any time after the mid - late 1920s ) , dog mu ##shing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation . various races are held around the state , but the best known is the id ##ita ##rod trail sl ##ed dog race , a 1 , 150 - mile ( 1 , 850 km ) trail from anchorage to no ##me ( although the distance varies from year to year , the official distance is set at 1 , 04 ##9 miles or 1 , 68 ##8 km ) . the race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to no ##me in which mu ##sher ##s and dogs like togo and bal ##to took much - needed medicine to the dip ##ht ##her ##ia - stricken community of no ##me when all other means of transportation had failed . mu ##sher ##s from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash , prizes , and prestige . the " serum run " is another sl ##ed dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay , leaving from the community of ne ##nan ##a ( southwest of fairbanks ) to no ##me .
thousands of people had learned to play the instrument [SEP] the second decline was not as complete as the first . thousands of people had learned to play the instrument . even as the second wave of mandolin popularity declined in the early 20th century , new versions of the mandolin began to be used in new forms of music . lu ##thi ##ers created the res ##ona ##tor mandolin , the flat ##back mandolin , the carved - top or arched - top mandolin , the mandolin - banjo and the electric mandolin . musicians began playing it in celtic , bluegrass , jazz and rock - n - roll styles — and classical too .
decay to silence [SEP] like any plucked instrument , mandolin notes decay to silence rather than sound out continuously as with a bowed note on a violin , and mandolin notes decay faster than larger string ##ed instruments like the guitar . this encourages the use of tre ##mo ##lo ( rapid picking of one or more pairs of strings ) to create sustained notes or chords . the mandolin ' s paired strings facilitate this technique : the pl ##ect ##rum ( pick ) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately , providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would .
complicated wood ##work [SEP] these styles generally have either two f - shaped sound ##holes like a violin ( f - 5 and a - 5 ) , or an oval sound hole ( f - 4 and a - 4 and lower models ) directly under the strings . much variation exists between makers working from these arch ##ety ##pes , and other variants have become increasingly common . generally , in the united states , gibson f - hole f - 5 mandolin ##s and mandolin ##s influenced by that design are strongly associated with bluegrass , while the a - style is associated other types of music , although it too is most often used for and associated with bluegrass . the f - 5 ' s more complicated wood ##work also translates into a more expensive instrument .
too soft - toned [SEP] though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for irish traditional music , virtually all irish players prefer flat - backed instruments with oval sound holes to the italian - style bowl - back mandolin ##s or the carved - top mandolin ##s with f - holes favoured by bluegrass mandolin ##ists . the former are often too soft - toned to hold their own in a session ( as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player ' s lap ) , whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and over ##be ##aring to the traditional ear . the f - hole mandolin , however , does come into its own in a traditional session , where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic cl ##utter of a pub . greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat - topped " irish - style " mandolin ##s ( reminiscent of the w ##wi - era martin army - navy mandolin ) and carved ( arch ) top mandolin ##s with oval sound ##holes , such as the gibson a - style of the 1920s .
per ##pet ##uating an out ##mo ##ded understanding of human biological variation [SEP] in some countries , law enforcement uses race to profile suspects . this use of racial categories is frequently criticized for per ##pet ##uating an out ##mo ##ded understanding of human biological variation , and promoting stereotypes . because in some societies racial grouping ##s correspond closely with patterns of social st ##rat ##ification , for social scientists studying social inequality , race can be a significant variable . as sociological factors , racial categories may in part reflect subjective at ##tri ##bution ##s , self - identities , and social institutions .
isolation by distance [SEP] one crucial innovation in rec ##on ##ce ##pt ##ual ##izing gen ##ot ##yp ##ic and ph ##eno ##typic variation was the anthropologist c . lori ##ng brace ' s observation that such variations , ins ##of ##ar as it is affected by natural selection , slow migration , or genetic drift , are distributed along geographic gr ##ada ##tions or cl ##ines . in part this is due to isolation by distance . this point called attention to a problem common to ph ##eno ##type - based descriptions of races ( for example , those based on hair texture and skin color ) : they ignore a host of other similarities and differences ( for example , blood type ) that do not co ##rre ##late highly with the markers for race . thus , anthropologist frank livingstone ' s conclusion , that since cl ##ines cross racial boundaries , " there are no races , only cl ##ines " .
it all falls apart [SEP] craig vent ##er and francis collins of the national institute of health jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000 . upon examining the data from the genome mapping , vent ##er realized that although the genetic variation within the human species is on the order of 1 – 3 % ( instead of the previously assumed 1 % ) , the types of variations do not support notion of genetically defined races . vent ##er said , " race is a social concept . it ' s not a scientific one . there are no bright lines ( that would stand out ) , if we could compare all the sequence ##d genome ##s of everyone on the planet . " " when we try to apply science to try to sort out these social differences , it all falls apart . "
all human beings belong to the same species [SEP] the concept of racial origin relies on the notion that human beings can be separated into biological ##ly distinct " races " , an idea generally rejected by the scientific community . since all human beings belong to the same species , the ec ##ri ( european commission against racism and into ##ler ##ance ) rejects theories based on the existence of different " races " . however , in its recommendation ec ##ri uses this term in order to ensure that those persons who are generally and erroneously perceived as belonging to " another race " are not excluded from the protection provided for by the legislation . the law claims to reject the existence of " race " , yet penal ##ize situations where someone is treated less favour ##ably on this ground .
sensitive issue [SEP] wang , st ##rka ##l ##j et al . ( 2003 ) examined the use of race as a biological concept in research papers published in china ' s only biological anthropology journal , act ##a ant ##hr ##op ##olo ##gic ##a sin ##ica . the study showed that the race concept was widely used among chinese anthropologist ##s . in a 2007 review paper , st ##rka ##l ##j suggested that the stark contrast of the racial approach between the united states and china was due to the fact that race is a factor for social co ##hesion among the ethnic ##ally diverse people of china , whereas " race " is a very sensitive issue in america and the racial approach is considered to undermine social co ##hesion - with the result that in the socio - political context of us academics scientists are encouraged not to use racial categories , whereas in china they are encouraged to use them .
is not itself scientific ##ally valid [SEP] " race " is still sometimes used within forensic anthropology ( when analyzing skeletal remains ) , biomedical research , and race - based medicine . brace has criticized this , the practice of forensic anthropologist ##s for using the controversial concept " race " out of convention when they in fact should be talking about regional ancestry . he argues that while forensic anthropologist ##s can determine that a skeletal remain comes from a person with ancestors in a specific region of africa , cat ##ego ##riz ##ing that skeletal as being " black " is a socially constructed category that is only meaningful in the particular context of the united states , and which is not itself scientific ##ally valid .

musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll [SEP] immediately after the war the saint - germain - des - pre ##s quarter and the nearby saint - michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs , mostly found in cellar ##s because of a lack of space ; these included the cave ##au des lori ##ent ##ais , the club saint - germain , the rose rouge , the vie ##ux - col ##om ##bie ##r , and the most famous , le tab ##ou . they introduced parisian ##s to the music of claude lu ##ter , boris via ##n , sydney be ##chet me ##zz me ##zz ##row , and henri salvador . most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s , as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll .
in order to keep the original forms [SEP] a lot of temples dedicated to apollo were built in greece and in the greek colonies , and they show the spread of the cult of apollo , and the evolution of the greek architecture , which was mostly based on the right ##ness of form , and on mathematical relations . some of the earliest temples , especially in crete , don ' t belong to any greek order . it seems that the first per ##ip ##tera ##l temples were rec ##tangle wooden structures . the different wooden elements were considered divine , and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of do ##ric order . the greeks used standard types , because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances . the temples should be canon ##ic , and the architects were trying to achieve the est ##hetic perfection . from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular per ##ip ##tera ##l and pro ##sty ##le buildings . the first buildings were narrow to hold the roof , and when the dimensions changed , some mathematical relations became necessary , in order to keep the original forms . this probably influenced the theory of numbers of p ##yt ##ha ##gor ##as , who believed that behind the appearance of things , there was the permanent principle of mathematics .
to hold the roof [SEP] a lot of temples dedicated to apollo were built in greece and in the greek colonies , and they show the spread of the cult of apollo , and the evolution of the greek architecture , which was mostly based on the right ##ness of form , and on mathematical relations . some of the earliest temples , especially in crete , don ' t belong to any greek order . it seems that the first per ##ip ##tera ##l temples were rec ##tangle wooden structures . the different wooden elements were considered divine , and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of do ##ric order . the greeks used standard types , because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances . the temples should be canon ##ic , and the architects were trying to achieve the est ##hetic perfection . from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular per ##ip ##tera ##l and pro ##sty ##le buildings . the first buildings were narrow to hold the roof , and when the dimensions changed , some mathematical relations became necessary , in order to keep the original forms . this probably influenced the theory of numbers of p ##yt ##ha ##gor ##as , who believed that behind the appearance of things , there was the permanent principle of mathematics .
for res ##ur ##re ##cting hip ##pol ##yt ##us from the dead [SEP] when zeus struck down apollo ' s son as ##cle ##pi ##us with a lightning bolt for res ##ur ##re ##cting hip ##pol ##yt ##us from the dead ( trans ##gre ##ssing them ##is by stealing hades ' s subjects ) , apollo in revenge killed the cy ##cl ##ope ##s , who had fashioned the bolt for zeus . apollo would have been banished to tar ##tar ##us forever for this , but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor , due to the inter ##ces ##sion of his mother , leto . during this time he served as shepherd for king ad ##met ##us of ph ##era ##e in the ##ssa ##ly . ad ##met ##us treated apollo well , and , in return , the god conferred great benefits on ad ##met ##us .
it was clear that the result in ohio , along with two other states who had still not declared ( new mexico and iowa ) , would decide the winner [SEP] the morning after the election , the major candidates were neck and neck . it was clear that the result in ohio , along with two other states who had still not declared ( new mexico and iowa ) , would decide the winner . bush had established a lead of around 130 , 000 votes but the democrats pointed to provisional ballots that had yet to be counted , initially reported to number as high as 200 , 000 . bush had preliminary leads of less than 5 % of the vote in only four states , but if iowa , nevada and new mexico had all eventually gone to kerry , a win for bush in ohio would have created a 269 – 269 tie in the electoral college . the result of an electoral tie would cause the election to be decided in the house of representatives with each state casting one vote , regardless of population . such a scenario would almost certainly have resulted in a victory for bush , as republicans controlled more house delegation ##s . therefore , the outcome of the election hi ##nged solely on the result in ohio , regardless of the final totals elsewhere . in the afternoon ohio ' s secretary of state , ken blackwell , announced that it was statistical ##ly impossible for the democrats to make up enough valid votes in the provisional ballots to win . at the time provisional ballots were reported as numbering 140 , 000 ( and later estimated to be only 135 , 000 ) . faced with this announcement , john kerry conceded defeat . had kerry won ohio , he would have won the election despite losing the national popular vote by over 3 million votes , a complete reversal of the 2000 election when bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to al gore by over 500 , 000 votes .
senator boxer claimed that she had made the motion not to challenge the outcome , but to " shed the light of truth on these irregularities . " [SEP] at the official counting of the electoral votes on january 6 , a motion was made contest ##ing ohio ' s electoral votes . because the motion was supported by at least one member of both the house of representatives and the senate , election law mandated that each house retire to debate and vote on the motion . in the house of representatives , the motion was supported by 31 democrats . it was opposed by 178 republicans , 88 democrats and one independent . not voting were 52 republicans and 80 democrats . four people elected to the house had not yet taken office , and one seat was vacant . in the senate , it was supported only by its maker , senator boxer , with 74 senators opposed and 25 not voting . during the debate , no senator argued that the outcome of the election should be changed by either court challenge or rev ##ote . senator boxer claimed that she had made the motion not to challenge the outcome , but to " shed the light of truth on these irregularities . "
executed [SEP] the japanese defenders recognized the possibility of a renewed invasion , and began construction of a great stone barrier around ha ##kata bay in 127 ##6 . completed in 127 ##7 , this wall stretched for 20 kilometers around the border of the bay . this would later serve as a strong defensive point against the mongols . the mongols attempted to settle matters in a diplomatic way from 127 ##5 to 127 ##9 , but every envoy sent to japan was executed . this set the stage for one of the most famous engagements in japanese history .
the buddhist concept of rein ##car ##nation and rebirth [SEP] the phil ##oso ##phi ##es of buddhism and zen , and to a lesser extent con ##fu ##cian ##ism and shin ##to , influenced the samurai culture . zen meditation became an important teaching due to it offering a process to calm one ' s mind . the buddhist concept of rein ##car ##nation and rebirth led samurai to abandon torture and needles ##s killing , while some samurai even gave up violence altogether and became buddhist monks after realizing how fruit ##less their killings were . some were killed as they came to terms with these realization ##s in the battlefield . the most defining role that con ##fu ##cian ##ism played in samurai philosophy was to stress the importance of the lord - retain ##er relationship — the loyalty that a samurai was required to show his lord .
her family ' s money erased the samurai ' s debts [SEP] a samurai could take con ##cu ##bine ##s but their backgrounds were checked by higher - ranked samurai . in many cases , taking a con ##cu ##bine was akin to a marriage . kidnapping a con ##cu ##bine , although common in fiction , would have been shame ##ful , if not criminal . if the con ##cu ##bine was a common ##er , a messenger was sent with bet ##rot ##hal money or a note for exemption of tax to ask for her parents ' acceptance . even though the woman would not be a legal wife , a situation normally considered a demo ##tion , many wealthy merchants believed that being the con ##cu ##bine of a samurai was superior to being the legal wife of a common ##er . when a merchant ' s daughter married a samurai , her family ' s money erased the samurai ' s debts , and the samurai ' s social status improved the standing of the merchant family . if a samurai ' s common ##er con ##cu ##bine gave birth to a son , the son could inherit his father ' s social status .
the son could inherit his father ' s social status [SEP] a samurai could take con ##cu ##bine ##s but their backgrounds were checked by higher - ranked samurai . in many cases , taking a con ##cu ##bine was akin to a marriage . kidnapping a con ##cu ##bine , although common in fiction , would have been shame ##ful , if not criminal . if the con ##cu ##bine was a common ##er , a messenger was sent with bet ##rot ##hal money or a note for exemption of tax to ask for her parents ' acceptance . even though the woman would not be a legal wife , a situation normally considered a demo ##tion , many wealthy merchants believed that being the con ##cu ##bine of a samurai was superior to being the legal wife of a common ##er . when a merchant ' s daughter married a samurai , her family ' s money erased the samurai ' s debts , and the samurai ' s social status improved the standing of the merchant family . if a samurai ' s common ##er con ##cu ##bine gave birth to a son , the son could inherit his father ' s social status .
it would em ##bar ##ras ##s the person who had arranged the marriage [SEP] a samurai could divorce his wife for a variety of reasons with approval from a superior , but divorce was , while not entirely none ##xi ##sten ##t , a rare event . a wife ' s failure to produce a son was cause for divorce , but adoption of a male heir was considered an acceptable alternative to divorce . a samurai could divorce for personal reasons , even if he simply did not like his wife , but this was generally avoided as it would em ##bar ##ras ##s the person who had arranged the marriage . a woman could also arrange a divorce , although it would generally take the form of the samurai di ##vor ##cing her . after a divorce samurai had to return the bet ##rot ##hal money , which often prevented divorce ##s .
lost interest in politics [SEP] this does not mean that samurai women were always powerless . powerful women both wise ##ly and un ##wise ##ly wi ##eld ##ed power at various occasions . after ash ##ika ##ga yo ##shima ##sa , 8th sho ##gun of the mu ##rom ##achi sho ##gun ##ate , lost interest in politics , his wife hi ##no tom ##iko largely ruled in his place . ne ##ne , wife of toy ##oto ##mi hide ##yoshi , was known to over ##ru ##le her husband ' s decisions at times and yo ##do - don ##o , his con ##cu ##bine , became the de facto master of osaka castle and the toy ##oto ##mi clan after hide ##yoshi ' s death . ta ##chi ##bana gin ##chi ##yo was chosen to lead the ta ##chi ##bana clan after her father ' s death . chi ##yo , wife of ya ##ma ##uchi ka ##zu ##toy ##o , has long been considered the ideal samurai wife . according to legend , she made her kim ##ono out of a quilt ##ed patch ##work of bits of old cloth and saved penn ##ies to buy her husband a magnificent horse , on which he rode to many victories . the fact that chi ##yo ( though she is better known as " wife of ya ##ma ##uchi ka ##zu ##toy ##o " ) is held in such high esteem for her economic sense is illuminating in the light of the fact that she never produced an heir and the ya ##ma ##uchi clan was succeeded by ka ##zu ##toy ##o ' s younger brother . the source of power for women may have been that samurai left their finances to their wives .
the advent of firearms , new fighting tactics and the need for additional protection [SEP] in the 1500 ##s a new type of armor started to become popular due to the advent of firearms , new fighting tactics and the need for additional protection . the ko ##zan ##e do ##u made from individual scales was replaced by plate armor . this new armor , which used iron plate ##d do ##u ( do ) , was referred to as to ##sei - gus ##oku , or modern armor . various other components of armor protected the samurai ' s body . the helmet ka ##bu ##to was an important part of the samurai ' s armor . samurai armor changed and developed as the methods of samurai warfare changed over the centuries . the known last use of samurai armor occurring in 1877 during the sat ##sum ##a rebellion . as the last samurai rebellion was crushed , japan modernized its defenses and turned to a national conscription army that used uniforms .
for their epic narratives and rich realism in depicting samurai and warrior culture [SEP] most common are historical works where the protagonist is either a samurai or former samurai ( or another rank or position ) who possesses considerable martial skill . e ##iji yo ##shi ##kawa is one of the most famous japanese historical novelist ##s . his re ##tell ##ings of popular works , including tai ##ko , musa ##shi and he ##ike tale , are popular among readers for their epic narratives and rich realism in depicting samurai and warrior culture . [ citation needed ] the samurai have also appeared frequently in japanese comics ( manga ) and animation ( anime ) . samurai - like characters are not just restricted to historical settings and a number of works set in the modern age , and even the future , include characters who live , train and fight like samurai . examples are samurai champ ##lo ##o , requiem from the darkness , mu ##rama ##sa : the demon blade , and afro samurai . some of these works have made their way to the west , where it has been increasing in popularity with america .
tests for even simple software components is practically infinite [SEP] as the number of possible tests for even simple software components is practically infinite , all software testing uses some strategy to select tests that are feasible for the available time and resources . as a result , software testing typically ( but not exclusively ) attempts to execute a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs ( errors or other defects ) . the job of testing is an it ##erative process as when one bug is fixed , it can ill ##umi ##nate other , deeper bugs , or can even create new ones .
stops working as intended [SEP] regression testing focuses on finding defects after a major code change has occurred . specifically , it seeks to uncover software regression ##s , as degraded or lost features , including old bugs that have come back . such regression ##s occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly , stops working as intended . typically , regression ##s occur as an un ##int ##ended consequence of program changes , when the newly developed part of the software col ##lide ##s with the previously existing code . common methods of regression testing include re - running previous sets of test - cases and checking whether previously fixed faults have re - emerged . the depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process and the risk of the added features . they can either be complete , for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky , or be very shallow , consisting of positive tests on each feature , if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk . regression testing is typically the largest test effort in commercial software development , due to checking numerous details in prior software features , and even new software can be developed while using some old test - cases to test parts of the new design to ensure prior functionality is still supported .
failed to reach the necessary majority vote in brandenburg [SEP] in 1952 , following a referendum , baden , wurttemberg - baden , and wurttemberg - ho ##hen ##zo ##ller ##n merged into baden - wurttemberg . in 1957 , the sa ##ar protectorate rejoined the federal republic as the sa ##ar ##land . german reunification in 1990 , in which the german democratic republic ( east germany ) ascended into the federal republic , resulted in the addition of the re - established eastern states of brandenburg , mecklenburg - west pomerania ( in german mecklenburg - vo ##rp ##om ##mer ##n ) , saxony ( sachs ##en ) , saxony - anhalt ( sachs ##en - anhalt ) , and th ##uring ##ia ( th ##uring ##en ) , as well as the reunification of west and east berlin into berlin and its establishment as a full and equal state . a regional referendum in 1996 to merge berlin with surrounding brandenburg as " berlin - brandenburg " failed to reach the necessary majority vote in brandenburg , while a majority of berlin ##ers voted in favour of the merger .
they became administrative regions [SEP] after the nazi party seized power in january 1933 , the land ##er increasingly lost importance . they became administrative regions of a central ##ised country . three changes are of particular note : on january 1 , 1934 , mecklenburg - sc ##h ##wer ##in was united with the neighbouring mecklenburg - st ##rel ##itz ; and , by the greater hamburg act ( gr ##o ##ß - hamburg - ge ##set ##z ) , from april 1 , 1937 , the area of the city - state was extended , while lu ##beck lost its independence and became part of the prussian province of schleswig - holstein .
soda [SEP] fused quartz is a glass made from chemical ##ly - pure si ##o ##2 ( si ##lica ) . it has excellent thermal shock characteristics , being able to survive immersion in water while red hot . however , its high melting - temperature ( 1723 °c ) and vis ##cos ##ity make it difficult to work with . normally , other substances are added to sim ##plify processing . one is sodium carbonate ( na ##2 ##co ##3 , " soda " ) , which lowers the glass transition temperature . the soda makes the glass water - soluble , which is usually und ##es ##ira ##ble , so lime ( calcium oxide [ cao ] , generally obtained from limestone ) , some magnesium oxide ( mg ##o ) and aluminium oxide ( al ##2 ##o ##3 ) are added to provide for a better chemical du ##ra ##bility . the resulting glass contains about 70 to 74 % si ##lica by weight and is called a soda - lime glass . soda - lime glasses account for about 90 % of manufactured glass .

removal of bubbles [SEP] following the glass batch preparation and mixing , the raw materials are transported to the furnace . soda - lime glass for mass production is melted in gas fired units . smaller scale furnace ##s for specialty glasses include electric melt ##ers , pot furnace ##s , and day tanks . after melting , homo ##gen ##ization and refining ( removal of bubbles ) , the glass is formed . flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process , developed between 1953 and 1957 by sir ala ##sta ##ir pi ##lk ##ington and kenneth bi ##cker ##sta ##ff of the uk ' s pi ##lk ##ington brothers , who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows un ##hin ##der ##ed under the influence of gravity . the top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish . container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods . this glass is often slightly modified chemical ##ly ( with more al ##umi ##na and calcium oxide ) for greater water resistance . further glass forming techniques are summarized in the table glass forming techniques .
for their diamond - like optical properties [SEP] glass has the ability to ref ##rac ##t , reflect , and transmit light following geometric ##al optics , without scattering it . it is used in the manufacture of lenses and windows . common glass has a ref ##raction index around 1 . 5 . this may be modified by adding low - density materials such as bo ##ron , which lowers the index of ref ##raction ( see crown glass ) , or increased ( to as much as 1 . 8 ) with high - density materials such as ( classical ##ly ) lead oxide ( see flint glass and lead glass ) , or in modern uses , less toxic oxide ##s of z ##ir ##con ##ium , titanium , or bari ##um . these high - index glasses ( inaccurate ##ly known as " crystal " when used in glass vessels ) cause more ch ##romatic di ##sper ##sion of light , and are prized for their diamond - like optical properties .
the cost factor has a low priority [SEP] new chemical glass compositions or new treatment techniques can be initially investigated in small - scale laboratory experiments . the raw materials for laboratory - scale glass melt ##s are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority . in the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used . care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment ( such as al ##kali or al ##kali ##ne earth metal oxide ##s and hydro ##xide ##s , or bo ##ron oxide ) , or that the imp ##urities are quan ##ti ##fied ( loss on ignition ) . eva ##por ##ation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials , e . g . , sodium se ##len ##ite may be preferred over easily eva ##por ##ating seo ##2 . also , more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively in ##ert ones , such as al ( oh ) 3 over al ##2 ##o ##3 . usually , the melt ##s are carried out in platinum cr ##ucible ##s to reduce contamination from the cr ##ucible material . glass homo ##gen ##eit ##y is achieved by homo ##gen ##izing the raw materials mixture ( glass batch ) , by stirring the melt , and by crushing and re - melting the first melt . the obtained glass is usually anne ##ale ##d to prevent break ##age during processing .

no photo ##ele ##ct ##rons are emitted at all [SEP] the " photo ##ele ##ct ##rons " emitted as a result of the photo ##ele ##ctric effect have a certain kinetic energy , which can be measured . this kinetic energy ( for each photo ##ele ##ct ##ron ) is independent of the intensity of the light , but depends linear ##ly on the frequency ; and if the frequency is too low ( corresponding to a photon energy that is less than the work function of the material ) , no photo ##ele ##ct ##rons are emitted at all , unless a plurality of photon ##s , whose energetic sum is greater than the energy of the photo ##ele ##ct ##rons , acts virtually simultaneously ( multi ##ph ##oton effect ) assuming the frequency is high enough to cause the photo ##ele ##ctric effect , a rise in intensity of the light source causes more photo ##ele ##ct ##rons to be emitted with the same kinetic energy , rather than the same number of photo ##ele ##ct ##rons to be emitted with higher kinetic energy .
to overcome a major short ##coming of rutherford ' s classical model [SEP] ni ##els bo ##hr introduced the first quan ##tized model of the atom in 1913 , in an attempt to overcome a major short ##coming of rutherford ' s classical model . in classical electro ##dy ##nami ##cs , a charge moving in a circle should ra ##dia ##te electromagnetic radiation . if that charge were to be an electron orbiting a nucleus , the radiation would cause it to lose energy and spiral down into the nucleus . bo ##hr solved this paradox with explicit reference to planck ' s work : an electron in a bo ##hr atom could only have certain defined energies en
it is ( or they are ) not as precise as is currently believed [SEP] there are both practical and theoretical difficulties in determining h . the practical difficulties can be illustrated by the fact that the two most accurate methods , the watt balance and the x - ray crystal density method , do not appear to agree with one another . the most likely reason is that the measurement uncertainty for one ( or both ) of the methods has been estimated too low – it is ( or they are ) not as precise as is currently believed – but for the time being there is no indication which method is at fault .
if these theories are slightly inaccurate [SEP] the theoretical difficulties arise from the fact that all of the methods except the x - ray crystal density method rely on the theoretical basis of the joseph ##son effect and the quantum hall effect . if these theories are slightly inaccurate – though there is no evidence at present to suggest they are – the methods would not give accurate values for the planck constant . more importantly , the values of the planck constant obtained in this way cannot be used as tests of the theories without falling into a circular argument . fortunately , there are other statistical ways of testing the theories , and the theories have yet to be ref ##uted .
electric current : this is invariably measured in conventional amp ##eres rather than in si amp ##eres [SEP] a further com ##plication is that the measurement of γ ′ p involves the measurement of an electric current : this is invariably measured in conventional amp ##eres rather than in si amp ##eres , so a conversion factor is required . the symbol γ ′ p - 90 is used for the measured g ##yr ##oma ##gne ##tic ratio using conventional electrical units . in addition , there are two methods of measuring the value , a " low - field " method and a " high - field " method , and the conversion factors are different in the two cases . only the high - field value γ ′ p - 90 ( hi ) is of interest in determining the planck constant .
dramatically lower solar prices [SEP] total investment in renewable energy ( including small hydro - electric projects ) was $ 244 billion in 2012 , down 12 % from 2011 mainly due to dramatically lower solar prices and weakened us and eu markets . as a share of total investment in power plants , wind and solar pv grew from 14 % in 2000 to over 60 % in 2012 . the top countries for investment in recent years were china , germany , spain , the united states , italy , and brazil . renewable energy companies include bright ##so ##ur ##ce energy , first solar , games ##a , ge energy , gold ##wind , sino ##vel , tri ##na solar , vest ##as and ying ##li .
the cost of renewable power falls [SEP] renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid - connected capacity in areas with good resources . as the cost of renewable power falls , the scope of economically viable applications increases . renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity . where " oil - fired generation is the predominant power generation source ( e . g . on islands , off - grid and in some countries ) a lower - cost renewable solution almost always exists today " . as of 2012 , renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally . in 2011 , additions included 41 gig ##awa ##tt ( g ##w ) of new wind power capacity , 30 g ##w of pv , 25 g ##w of hydro - electricity , 6 g ##w of biomass , 0 . 5 g ##w of cs ##p , and 0 . 1 g ##w of geo ##thermal power .
because they are trained to think only in terms of big , conventional power plants [SEP] many energy markets , institutions , and policies have been developed to support the production and use of fossil fuels . newer and cleaner technologies may offer social and environmental benefits , but utility operators often reject renewable resources because they are trained to think only in terms of big , conventional power plants . consumers often ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption . intentional market distortion ##s ( such as subsidies ) , and un ##int ##ent ##ional market distortion ##s ( such as split incentives ) may work against renewable ##s . benjamin k . so ##vac ##ool has argued that " some of the most sur ##re ##pt ##iti ##ous , yet powerful , imp ##ed ##ime ##nts facing renewable energy and energy efficiency in the united states are more about culture and institutions than engineering and science " .

can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand [SEP] similarly , in the united states , the independent national research council has noted that " sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change , energy security , and the es ##cala ##tion of energy costs … renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states , taken collectively , can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand . " .
in order to distinguish it from a second settlement built during the 5th century bc , called ne ##ap ##olis [SEP] the first settlement is defined as pale ##ap ##olis ( π ##α ##λ ##ε ##α ##π ##ο ##λ ##ι ##ς ) , the ancient greek world for " old city " , in order to distinguish it from a second settlement built during the 5th century bc , called ne ##ap ##olis ( ν ##ε ##α ##π ##ο ##λ ##ι ##ς ) , " new city " . the ne ##ap ##olis was erected towards the east and along with it , monumental walls around the whole settlement were built to prevent attacks from foreign threats . some part of this structure can still be seen in the cass ##aro district . this district was named after the walls themselves ; the word cass ##aro der ##iving from the arab al - q ##sr ( castle , stronghold ) . along the walls there were few doors to access and exit the city , suggesting that trade even toward the inner part of the island occurred frequently . moreover , according to some studies , it may be possible that there were some walls that divided the old city from the new one too . the colony developed around a central street ( dec ##uman ##us ) , cut perpendicular ##ly by minor streets . this street today has become the co ##rso vittorio emanuel ##e .
carthage and syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the romans from gaining full control of the island during the first pun ##ic war [SEP] carthage was palermo ’ s major trading partner under the ph ##oe ##nic ##ians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period . palermo came into contact with the ancient greeks between the 6th and the 5th centuries bc which preceded the sicilian wars , a conflict fought between the greeks of syracuse and the ph ##oe ##nic ##ians of carthage for control over the island of sicily . during this war the greeks named the settlement pan ##or ##mos ( π ##α ##ν ##ο ##ρ ##μ ##ος ) from which the current name is derived , meaning " all port " due to the shape of its coast . it was from palermo that ham ##il ##car i ' s fleet ( which was defeated at the battle of him ##era ) was launched . in 40 ##9 b . c . the city was looted by her ##mo ##crat ##es of syracuse . the sicilian wars ended in 265 bc when carthage and syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the romans from gaining full control of the island during the first pun ##ic war . in 276 bc , during the p ##yr ##rh ##ic war , pan ##or ##mos briefly became a greek colony after being conquered by p ##yr ##rh ##us of ep ##irus , but returned to ph ##oe ##nic ##ian carthage in 275 . in 254 bc pan ##or ##mos was besieged and conquered by the romans in the first battle of pan ##or ##mus ( the name latin name ) . carthage attempted to rec ##on ##que ##r pan ##or ##mus in 251 bc but failed .
meaning " all port " due to the shape of its coast . [SEP] carthage was palermo ’ s major trading partner under the ph ##oe ##nic ##ians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period . palermo came into contact with the ancient greeks between the 6th and the 5th centuries bc which preceded the sicilian wars , a conflict fought between the greeks of syracuse and the ph ##oe ##nic ##ians of carthage for control over the island of sicily . during this war the greeks named the settlement pan ##or ##mos ( π ##α ##ν ##ο ##ρ ##μ ##ος ) from which the current name is derived , meaning " all port " due to the shape of its coast . it was from palermo that ham ##il ##car i ' s fleet ( which was defeated at the battle of him ##era ) was launched . in 40 ##9 b . c . the city was looted by her ##mo ##crat ##es of syracuse . the sicilian wars ended in 265 bc when carthage and syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the romans from gaining full control of the island during the first pun ##ic war . in 276 bc , during the p ##yr ##rh ##ic war , pan ##or ##mos briefly became a greek colony after being conquered by p ##yr ##rh ##us of ep ##irus , but returned to ph ##oe ##nic ##ian carthage in 275 . in 254 bc pan ##or ##mos was besieged and conquered by the romans in the first battle of pan ##or ##mus ( the name latin name ) . carthage attempted to rec ##on ##que ##r pan ##or ##mus in 251 bc but failed .
emigrated or were expelled [SEP] sicily fell under the control of the holy roman empire in 119 ##4 . palermo was the preferred city of the emperor frederick ii . muslims of palermo emigrated or were expelled during holy roman rule . after an interval of ang ##ev ##in rule ( 126 ##6 – 128 ##2 ) , sicily came under control of the aragon and barcelona dynasties . by 133 ##0 , palermo ' s population had declined to 51 , 000 . from 147 ##9 until 1713 palermo was ruled by the kingdom of spain , and again between 1717 and 1718 . palermo was also under savoy control between 1713 and 1717 and 1718 – 1720 as a result of the treaty of utrecht . it was also ruled by austria between 1720 and 1734 .
reduced importance of agriculture in the sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities [SEP] the so - called " sack of palermo " is one of the major visible faces of the problem . the term is used to indicate the speculative building practices that have filled the city with poor buildings . the reduced importance of agriculture in the sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities , especially palermo , which swelled in size , leading to rapid expansion towards the north . the regulatory plans for expansion was largely ignored in the boom . new parts of town appeared almost out of nowhere , but without parks , schools , public buildings , proper roads and the other amenities that character ##ise a modern city .
population flight to the suburbs [SEP] in 2010 , there were 1 . 2 million people living in the greater palermo area , 65 ##5 , 875 of which resided in the city boundaries , of whom 47 . 4 % were male and 52 . 6 % were female . people under age 15 total ##led 15 . 6 % compared to pension ##ers who composed 17 . 2 % of the population . this compares with the italian average of 14 . 1 % people under 15 years and 20 . 2 % pension ##ers . the average age of a palermo resident is 40 . 4 compared to the italian average of 42 . 8 . in the ten years between 2001 and 2010 , the population of palermo declined by 4 . 5 % , while the population of italy , as a whole , grew by 6 . 0 % . the reason for palermo ' s decline is a population flight to the suburbs , and to northern italy . the current birth rate of palermo is 10 . 2 births per 1 , 000 inhabitants compared to the italian average of 9 . 3 births .
its association with nature [SEP] in surveys made in europe and the united states , green is the color most commonly associated with nature , life , health , youth , spring , hope and envy . in europe and the u . s . green is sometimes associated with death ( green has several seemingly contrary associations ) , sickness , or the devil , but in china its associations are very positive , as the symbol of fertility and happiness . in the middle ages and renaissance , when the color of clothing showed the owner ' s social status , green was worn by merchants , bankers and the gentry , while red was the color of the nobility . the mona lisa by leonardo da vinci wears green , showing she is not from a noble family ; the benches in the british house of commons are green , while those in the house of lords are red . green is also the traditional color of safety and permission ; a green light means go ahead , a green card permits permanent residence in the united states . it is the most important color in islam . it was the color of the banner of muhammad , and is found in the flags of nearly all islamic countries , and represents the lush vegetation of paradise . it is also often associated with the culture of gaelic ireland , and is a color of the flag of ireland . because of its association with nature , it is the color of the environmental movement . political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the green movement , some naming themselves green parties . this has led to similar campaigns in advertising , as companies have sold green , or environmentally friendly , products .
ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l [SEP] green is common in nature , as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , which is involved in photos ##yn ##thesis . ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l absorb ##s the long wavelengths of light ( red ) and short wavelengths of light ( blue ) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye , so light reflected by plants is enriched in green . ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l absorb ##s green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halo ##ba ##cter ##ia were already exploit ##ing photos ##yn ##thesis . their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using ba ##cter ##ior ##ho ##do ##ps ##in . the new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halo ##ba ##cter ##ia .
reflection of blue light coming through an over - layer of yellow pigment [SEP] animals typically use the color green as camouflage , blending in with the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l green of the surrounding environment . green animals include , especially , amp ##hi ##bians , reptiles , and some fish , birds and insects . most fish , reptiles , amp ##hi ##bians , and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over - layer of yellow pigment . perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment . for example , broad ##leaf forests typically have a yellow - green light about them as the trees filter the light . tu ##rac ##over ##din is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds , especially . invertebrates such as insects or mollusk ##s often display green colors because of por ##phy ##rin pigment ##s , sometimes caused by diet . this can causes their fe ##ces to look green as well . other chemicals which generally contribute to green ##ness among organisms are fl ##avi ##ns ( l ##ych ##och ##rom ##es ) and hem ##anov ##adi ##n . humans have im ##itated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields . substances that may imp ##art a greenish hue to one ' s skin include bi ##li ##ver ##din , the green pigment in bile , and ce ##ru ##lo ##pl ##as ##min , a protein that carries copper ions in che ##lation .
to protect them from evil [SEP] for the ancient egyptians , green had very positive associations . the hi ##ero ##gly ##ph for green represented a growing papyrus sp ##rou ##t , showing the close connection between green , vegetation , vigor and growth . in wall paintings , the ruler of the underworld , os ##iri ##s , was typically portrayed with a green face , because green was the symbol of good health and rebirth . palette ##s of green facial makeup , made with mala ##chi ##te , were found in tombs . it was worn by both the living and dead , particularly around the eyes , to protect them from evil . tombs also often contained small green amulet ##s in the shape of scar ##ab beetles made of mala ##chi ##te , which would protect and give vigor to the deceased . it also symbol ##ized the sea , which was called the " very green . "
they rapidly faded or changed color [SEP] unfortunately for those who wanted or were required to wear green , there were no good ve ##get ##al green dye ##s which resisted washing and sunlight . green dye ##s were made out of the fern , plant ##ain , buck ##thor ##n berries , the juice of net ##tle ##s and of lee ##ks , the digital ##is plant , the broom plant , the leaves of the fra ##xin ##us , or ash tree , and the bark of the al ##der tree , but they rapidly faded or changed color . only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced , by first dye ##ing the cloth blue with wo ##ad , and then yellow with res ##eda lu ##te ##ola , also known as yellow - weed .
copper or arsenic [SEP] like other common colors , green has several completely opposite associations . while it is the color most associated by europeans and americans with good health , it is also the color most often associated with toxicity and poison . there was a solid foundation for this association ; in the nineteenth century several popular paints and pigment ##s , notably verdi ##gr ##is , ve ##rt de sc ##h ##wei ##n ##furt and ve ##rt de paris , were highly toxic , containing copper or arsenic . [ d ] the into ##xi ##cating drink abs ##int ##he was known as " the green fairy " .
environmental ##ism [SEP] in the 1980s green became the color of a number of new european political parties organized around an agenda of environmental ##ism . green was chosen for its association with nature , health , and growth . the largest green party in europe is alliance ' 90 / the greens ( german : bun ##d ##nis 90 / die gr ##une ##n ) in germany , which was formed in 1993 from the merger of the german green party , founded in west germany in 1980 , and alliance 90 , founded during the revolution of 1989 – 1990 in east germany . in the 2009 federal elections , the party won 10 . 7 % of the votes and 68 out of 62 ##2 seats in the bun ##des ##tag .
zinc deficiency [SEP] zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional bio ##logic and public health importance " , especially regarding pre ##nat ##al and post ##nat ##al development . zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . in children it causes growth re ##tar ##dation , delayed sexual mat ##uration , infection su ##sc ##ept ##ibility , and dia ##rr ##hea . enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol de ##hy ##dro ##genase in humans . consumption of excess zinc can cause ata ##xia , let ##har ##gy and copper deficiency .
excess zinc [SEP] zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional bio ##logic and public health importance " , especially regarding pre ##nat ##al and post ##nat ##al development . zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . in children it causes growth re ##tar ##dation , delayed sexual mat ##uration , infection su ##sc ##ept ##ibility , and dia ##rr ##hea . enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol de ##hy ##dro ##genase in humans . consumption of excess zinc can cause ata ##xia , let ##har ##gy and copper deficiency .
becomes mall ##ea ##ble [SEP] zinc is a blu ##ish - white , lust ##rous , dia ##ma ##gne ##tic metal , though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish . it is somewhat less dense than iron and has a he ##xa ##gonal crystal structure , with a distorted form of he ##xa ##gonal close packing , in which each atom has six nearest neighbors ( at 265 . 9 pm ) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290 . 6 pm . the metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes mall ##ea ##ble between 100 and 150 °c . above 210 °c , the metal becomes brittle again and can be pu ##lver ##ized by beating . zinc is a fair conductor of electricity . for a metal , zinc has relatively low melting ( 41 ##9 . 5 °c ) and boiling points ( 90 ##7 °c ) . its melting point is the lowest of all the transition metals aside from mercury and cad ##mium .
metallic zinc crystals have a needle - like appearance [SEP] the name of the metal was probably first documented by para ##cel ##sus , a swiss - born german al ##chemist , who referred to the metal as " zinc ##um " or " z ##ink ##en " in his book li ##ber mineral ##ium ii , in the 16th century . the word is probably derived from the german z ##ink ##e , and supposedly meant " tooth - like , pointed or jagged " ( metallic zinc crystals have a needle - like appearance ) . z ##ink could also imply " tin - like " because of its relation to german z ##inn meaning tin . yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the persian word س ##ن ##گ sen ##g meaning stone . the metal was also called indian tin , tu ##tan ##ego , cal ##amine , and spin ##ter .
imply " tin - like " [SEP] the name of the metal was probably first documented by para ##cel ##sus , a swiss - born german al ##chemist , who referred to the metal as " zinc ##um " or " z ##ink ##en " in his book li ##ber mineral ##ium ii , in the 16th century . the word is probably derived from the german z ##ink ##e , and supposedly meant " tooth - like , pointed or jagged " ( metallic zinc crystals have a needle - like appearance ) . z ##ink could also imply " tin - like " because of its relation to german z ##inn meaning tin . yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the persian word س ##ن ##گ sen ##g meaning stone . the metal was also called indian tin , tu ##tan ##ego , cal ##amine , and spin ##ter .
mining operations leach significant amounts of zinc and cad ##mium [SEP] the production for sul ##fi ##dic zinc ore ##s produces large amounts of sulfur dioxide and cad ##mium vapor . sm ##elt ##er sl ##ag and other residues of process also contain significant amounts of heavy metals . about 1 . 1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and sm ##elt ##ed in the belgian towns of la cal ##amine and pl ##om ##bie ##res between 1806 and 1882 . the dump ##s of the past mining operations leach significant amounts of zinc and cad ##mium , and , as a result , the sediments of the ge ##ul river contain significant amounts of heavy metals . about two thousand years ago emissions of zinc from mining and sm ##elt ##ing totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year . after increasing 10 - fold from 1850 , zinc emissions peaked at 3 . 4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2 . 7 million tonnes in the 1990s , although a 2005 study of the arctic tr ##op ##osphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline . ant ##hr ##op ##ogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1 .
will slowly co ##rro ##de , whereas the rudder stays una ##tta ##cked [SEP] the relative react ##ivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sac ##ri ##fi ##cial an ##ode in cat ##ho ##dic protection ( cp ) . for example , cat ##ho ##dic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting an ##odes made from zinc to the pipe . zinc acts as the an ##ode ( negative terminus ) by slowly co ##rro ##ding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline . [ note 2 ] zinc is also used to cat ##ho ##dic ##ally protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion . a zinc disc attached to a ship ' s iron rudder will slowly co ##rro ##de , whereas the rudder stays una ##tta ##cked . other similar uses include a plug of zinc attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship .
too expensive [SEP] similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold - rolled into sheets . an alloy of 96 % zinc and 4 % aluminium is used to make stamp ##ing dies for low production run applications for which fe ##rro ##us metal dies would be too expensive . in building facades , roofs or other applications in which zinc is used as sheet metal and for methods such as deep drawing , roll forming or bending , zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used . una ##llo ##yed zinc is too brittle for these kinds of manufacturing processes .
semiconductor [SEP] roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the united states ( 2009 ) , is consumed in the form of zinc compounds ; a variety of which are used industrial ##ly . zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints , and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber . it is also used as a heat disperse ##r for the rubber and acts to protect its polymers from ultraviolet radiation ( the same uv protection is conferred to plastics containing zinc oxide ) . the semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in var ##isto ##rs and photo ##co ##py ##ing products . the zinc zinc - oxide cycle is a two step the ##rm ##oche ##mic ##al process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production .
anti - corrosion agent [SEP] 64 ##z ##n , the most abundant isotope of zinc , is very susceptible to neutron activation , being trans ##mute ##d into the highly radioactive 65 ##z ##n , which has a half - life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation . because of this , zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti - corrosion agent is depleted of 64 ##z ##n before use , this is called depleted zinc oxide . for the same reason , zinc has been proposed as a salt ##ing material for nuclear weapons ( cobalt is another , better - known salt ##ing material ) . a jacket of iso ##top ##ically enriched 64 ##z ##n would be ir ##rad ##iated by the intense high - energy neutron flux from an exploding the ##rm ##on ##uc ##lea ##r weapon , forming a large amount of 65 ##z ##n significantly increasing the radio ##act ##ivity of the weapon ' s fallout . such a weapon is not known to have ever been built , tested , or used . 65 ##z ##n is also used as a trace ##r to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out , or the path and the role of zinc in organisms .
nearly ins ##ol ##ub ##le [SEP] other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements , which come in various forms . a 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide , one of the most common supplements in the united states , and zinc carbonate are nearly ins ##ol ##ub ##le and poorly absorbed in the body . this review cited studies which found low plasma zinc concentrations after zinc oxide and zinc carbonate were consumed compared with those seen after consumption of zinc ace ##tate and sulfate salts . however , harmful excessive supplement ##ation is a problem among the relatively affluent , and should probably not exceed 20 mg / day in healthy people , although the u . s . national research council set a to ##ler ##able upper intake of 40 mg / day .
pol ##io infections [SEP] the u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ) has stated that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose , which can cause an ##os ##mia . reports of an ##os ##mia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent pol ##io infections . on june 16 , 2009 , the fda said that consumers should stop using zinc - based intra ##nas ##al cold products and ordered their removal from store shelves . the fda said the loss of smell can be life - threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it . recent research suggests that the topical anti ##mic ##ro ##bial zinc p ##yr ##ith ##ion ##e is a potent heat shock response induce ##r that may imp ##air gen ##omic integrity with induction of par ##p - dependent energy crisis in culture ##d human ke ##rat ##ino ##cytes and mel ##ano ##cytes .
population migration ##s [SEP] south slavic dialects historically formed a continuum . the turbulent history of the area , particularly due to expansion of the ottoman empire , resulted in a patch ##work of dialect ##al and religious differences . due to population migration ##s , sh ##tok ##avian became the most widespread in the western balkans , int ##rud ##ing westward ##s into the area previously occupied by cha ##ka ##vian and ka ##jk ##avian ( which further blend into slovenian in the northwest ) . bosnia ##ks , croats and serbs differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles , although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign over ##lord ##s . during that period , the language was referred to under a variety of names , such as " slavic " , " ill ##yria ##n " , or according to region , " bosnian " , " serbian " and " croatian " , the latter often in combination with " sl ##av ##onia ##n " or " dal ##mat ##ian " .
most widespread dialect [SEP] in the mid - 19th century , serbian ( led by self - taught writer and folk ##lor ##ist vu ##k stefano ##vic kara ##d ##zic ) and most croatian writers and linguist ##s ( represented by the ill ##yria ##n movement and led by l ##ju ##dev ##it ga ##j and đ ##uro dani ##cic ) , proposed the use of the most widespread dialect , sh ##tok ##avian , as the base for their common standard language . kara ##d ##zic standard ##ised the serbian cyrillic alphabet , and ga ##j and dani ##cic standardized the croatian latin alphabet , on the basis of vernacular speech phone ##mes and the principle of ph ##ono ##logical spelling . in 1850 serbian and croatian writers and linguist ##s signed the vienna literary agreement , declaring their intention to create a unified standard . thus a complex bi - variant language appeared , which the serbs officially called " serb ##o - croatian " or " serbian or croatian " and the croats " cr ##oat ##o - serbian " , or " croatian or serbian " . yet , in practice , the variants of the conceived common literary language served as different literary variants , chiefly differing in lexi ##cal inventory and stylistic devices . the common phrase describing this situation was that serb ##o - croatian or " croatian or serbian " was a single language . during the austro - hungarian occupation of bosnia and herzegovina , the language of all three nations was called " bosnian " until the death of administrator von ka ##lla ##y in 1907 , at which point the name was changed to " serb ##o - croatian " .
migration ##s from the 16th to 18th centuries resulting from the spread of ottoman empire on the balkans [SEP] south slavic historically formed a dialect continuum , i . e . each dialect has some similarities with the neighboring one , and differences grow with distance . however , migration ##s from the 16th to 18th centuries resulting from the spread of ottoman empire on the balkans have caused large - scale population displacement that broke the dialect continuum into many geographical pockets . migration ##s in the 20th century , primarily caused by urban ##ization and wars , also contributed to the reduction of dialect ##al differences .
due to potential ambiguity with pri [SEP] the ja ##t - reflex rules are not without exception . for example , when short ja ##t is preceded by r , in most i ##je ##ka ##vian dialects developed into / re / or , occasionally , / ri / . the prefix pre - ( " trans - , over - " ) when long became pre - in eastern i ##je ##ka ##vian dialects but to pri ##je - in western dialects ; in ik ##avian pronunciation , it also evolved into pre - or pri ##je - due to potential ambiguity with pri - ( " approach , come close to " ) . for verbs that had - et ##i in their in ##fin ##itive , the past part ##ici ##ple ending - el evolved into - io in i ##je ##ka ##vian neo ##sto ##ka ##vian .
to simulcast the american version of the one over the summer [SEP] many were surprised by these changes to the cbc schedule , which were apparently intended to attract a younger audience to the network ; some suggested they might alien ##ate the core cbc viewers ##hip . another note of criticism was made when the network decided to move the national in some time zones to simulcast the american version of the one over the summer . this later became a mo ##ot point , as the one was taken off the air after two weeks after extremely low american and canadian ratings , and the newscast resumed its regular schedule .
more complete and consistent [SEP] cbc ' s sports coverage has also attained high viewers ##hip in border markets , including its coverage of the nhl ' s stanley cup playoffs , which was generally considered to be more complete and consistent than coverage by other networks such as nbc . its coverage of the olympic games also found a significant audience in border regions , primarily due to the fact that cbc aired more events live than nbc ' s coverage , which had been criticized in recent years for tape delaying events to air in primetime , even if the event is being held in a market in the pacific time zone during primetime hours on the east ( where it would still be delayed for west coast primetime ) .
tape delaying events to air in primetime [SEP] cbc ' s sports coverage has also attained high viewers ##hip in border markets , including its coverage of the nhl ' s stanley cup playoffs , which was generally considered to be more complete and consistent than coverage by other networks such as nbc . its coverage of the olympic games also found a significant audience in border regions , primarily due to the fact that cbc aired more events live than nbc ' s coverage , which had been criticized in recent years for tape delaying events to air in primetime , even if the event is being held in a market in the pacific time zone during primetime hours on the east ( where it would still be delayed for west coast primetime ) .
reminding broadcasters that analog transmitters had to be shut off by the deadline in mandatory markets [SEP] on november 30 , 2010 , cbc ' s senior director of regulatory affairs issued a letter to the cr ##tc regarding cbc ' s plans for transition ##ing to digital . the letter states , " cbc / radio - canada will not be converting its analogue re ##tra ##ns ##mit ##ters in mandatory markets to digital after august 31 , 2011 . " on december 16 , 2010 , some months after the cr ##tc issued a bulletin reminding broadcasters that analog transmitters had to be shut off by the deadline in mandatory markets , the cbc revised the documents accompanying its august 6 , 2010 news release to state that it had the money for and is st ##ri ##ving to transition all 27 transmitters by august 31 , 2011 .
the proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement for great britain ' s thirteen original colonies in north america to east of the summit line of the mountains [SEP] before the french and indian war , the appalachian mountains laid on the ind ##eter ##minate boundary between britain ' s colonies along the atlantic and french areas centered in the mississippi basin . after the french and indian war , the proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement for great britain ' s thirteen original colonies in north america to east of the summit line of the mountains ( except in the northern regions where the great lakes formed the boundary ) . although the line was adjusted several times to take frontier settlements into account and was impossible to enforce as law , it was strongly resented by back ##co ##unt ##ry settlers throughout the appalachian ##s . the proclamation line can be seen as one of the gr ##ie ##vances which led to the american revolutionary war . many frontier settlers held that the defeat of the french opened the land west of the mountains to english settlement , only to find settlement barred by the british king ' s proclamation . the back ##co ##unt ##ry settlers who fought in the illinois campaign of george rogers clark were motivated to secure their settlement of kentucky .
because it is statistical ##ly unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces [SEP] there are strict limits to how efficiently heat can be converted into work in a cyclic process , e . g . in a heat engine , as described by car ##not ' s theorem and the second law of the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mics . however , some energy transformations can be quite efficient . the direction of transformations in energy ( what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind ) is often determined by entropy ( equal energy spread among all available degrees of freedom ) considerations . in practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale , but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistical ##ly unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces .
mass equivalent of a unit of energy is minus ##cule [SEP] matter may be converted to energy ( and vice versa ) , but mass cannot ever be destroyed ; rather , mass / energy equivalence remains a constant for both the matter and the energy , during any process when they are converted into each other . however , since is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales , the conversion of ordinary amount of matter ( for example , 1 kg ) to other forms of energy ( such as heat , light , and other radiation ) can li ##ber ##ate tremendous amounts of energy ( ~ jo ##ules = 21 mega ##ton ##s of tnt ) , as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons . conversely , the mass equivalent of a unit of energy is minus ##cule , which is why a loss of energy ( loss of mass ) from most systems is difficult to measure by weight , unless the energy loss is very large . examples of energy transformation into matter ( i . e . , kinetic energy into particles with rest mass ) are found in high - energy nuclear physics .
because the duchy was outside of the core holy roman empire [SEP] because the duchy was outside of the core holy roman empire , the prince - electors of brandenburg were able to pro ##claim themselves king of prussia beginning in 1701 . after the annexation of most of western royal prussia in the first partition of the polish - lithuanian commonwealth in 1772 , eastern ( duc ##al ) prussia was connected by land with the rest of the prussian state and was reorganized as a province the following year ( 1773 ) . between 1829 and 1878 , the province of east prussia was joined with west prussia to form the province of prussia .
albert ' s line died out [SEP] the administrator of prussia , the grandmaster of the te ##uto ##nic order maximilian iii , son of emperor maximilian ii died in 1618 . when maximilian died , albert ' s line died out , and the duchy of prussia passed to the electors of brandenburg , forming brandenburg - prussia . taking advantage of the swedish invasion of poland in 1655 , and instead of fulfilling his vassal ' s duties towards the polish kingdom , by joining forces with the sw ##edes and subsequent treaties of we ##hl ##au , lab ##ia ##u , and ol ##iva , elector and duke frederick william succeeded in rev ##oki ##ng king of poland ' s sovereignty over the duchy of prussia in 1660 . the abs ##ol ##uti ##st elector also subdued the noble estates of prussia .
german army had been directed towards the western front [SEP] at the beginning of world war i , east prussia became a theatre of war when the russian empire invaded the country . the russian army encountered at first little resistance because the bulk of the german army had been directed towards the western front according to the sc ##hli ##ef ##fen plan . despite early success and the capture of the towns of ras ##ten ##burg and gum ##bin ##nen , in the battle of tan ##nen ##berg in 1914 and the second battle of the mas ##urian lakes in 1915 , the russians were decisive ##ly defeated and forced to retreat . the russians were followed by the german army advancing into russian territory .
sent to concentration camps [SEP] in 1938 the nazis altered about one - third of the top ##ony ##ms of the area , eliminating , german ##izing , or sim ##plify ##ing a number of old prussian names , as well as those polish or lithuanian names originating from colonists and refugees to prussia during and after the protestant reformation . more than 1 , 500 places were ordered to be renamed by 16 july 1938 following a decree issued by gaul ##eit ##er and obe ##rp ##ras ##ide ##nt erich koch and initiated by adolf hitler . many who would not cooperate with the rulers of nazi germany were sent to concentration camps and held prisoner there until their death or liberation .

[SEP] in 1939 east prussia had 2 . 49 million inhabitants , 85 % of them ethnic germans , the others poles in the south who , according to polish estimates numbered in the inter ##war period around 300 , 000 - 350 , 000 , the latvian speaking ku ##rse ##nie ##ki , and lie ##tu ##vin ##ink ##ai who spoke lithuanian in the northeast . most german east prussian ##s , mas ##urian ##s , ku ##rs ##ien ##iki , and lie ##tu ##vin ##ink ##ai were lutheran , while the population of er ##ml ##and was mainly roman catholic due to the history of its bishopric . the east prussian jewish congregation declined from about 9 , 000 in 1933 to 3 , 000 in 1939 , as most fled from nazi rule . those who remained were later deported and killed in the holocaust .
evacuated during the war [SEP] following nazi germany ' s defeat in world war ii in 1945 , east prussia was partition ##ed between poland and the soviet union according to the potsdam conference . southern east prussia was placed under polish administration , while northern east prussia was divided between the soviet republics of russia ( the kali ##ning ##rad oblast ) and lithuania ( the constituent counties of the k ##lai ##ped ##a region ) . the city of ko ##nig ##sberg was renamed kali ##ning ##rad in 1946 . the german population of the province largely evacuated during the war , but several hundreds of thousands died during the years 1944 – 46 and the remainder were subsequently expelled .
expelled by the soviet union [SEP] a similar fate be ##fell the cu ##ronia ##ns who lived in the area around the cu ##ronia ##n lagoon . while many fled from the red army during the evacuation of east prussia , cu ##ronia ##ns that remained behind were subsequently expelled by the soviet union . only 219 lived along the cu ##ronia ##n spit in 1955 . many had german names such as fritz or hans , a cause for anti - german discrimination . the soviet authorities considered the cu ##ronia ##ns fascist ##s . because of this discrimination , many immigrated to west germany in 1958 , where the majority of cu ##ronia ##ns now live .
the world ' s first specialized reconnaissance training program was started [SEP] the establishment of ottoman military aviation dates back to between june 1909 and july 1911 . the ottoman empire started preparing its first pilots and planes , and with the founding of the aviation school ( tay ##yar ##e me ##kt ##eb ##i ) in yes ##il ##ko ##y on 3 july 1912 , the empire began to tutor its own flight officers . the founding of the aviation school quick ##ened advancement in the military aviation program , increased the number of enlisted persons within it , and gave the new pilots an active role in the ottoman army and navy . in may 1913 the world ' s first specialized reconnaissance training program was started by the aviation school and the first separate reconnaissance division was established . [ citation needed ] in june 1914 a new military academy , the naval aviation school ( ba ##hri ##ye tay ##yar ##e me ##kt ##eb ##i ) was founded . with the outbreak of world war i , the modernization process stopped abruptly . the ottoman aviation squadrons fought on many fronts during world war i , from galicia in the west to the caucasus in the east and yemen in the south .
the wide ethnic range of the ottoman empire [SEP] examples of ottoman architecture of the classical period , besides istanbul and ed ##ir ##ne , can also be seen in egypt , eritrea , tunisia , algiers , the balkans and romania , where mosques , bridges , fountains and schools were built . the art of ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the ottoman empire . the greatest of the court artists enriched the ottoman empire with many plural ##istic artistic influences : such as mixing traditional byzantine art with elements of chinese art .
domestic ##ation of large animals [SEP] the domestic ##ation of large animals ( c . 800 ##0 bc ) resulted in a dramatic increase in social inequality in most of the areas where it occurred ; new guinea being a notable exception . possession of livestock allowed competition between households and resulted in inherited in ##e ##qual ##ities of wealth . neolithic pastoral ##ists who controlled large herds gradually acquired more livestock , and this made economic in ##e ##qual ##ities more pronounced . however , evidence of social inequality is still disputed , as settlements such as cat ##al hu ##yu ##k reveal a striking lack of difference in the size of homes and burial sites , suggesting a more e ##gal ##itarian society with no evidence of the concept of capital , although some homes do appear slightly larger or more elaborate ##ly decorated than others .
reading von mis ##es ' book socialism [SEP] initially sympathetic to wi ##ese ##r ' s democratic socialism , hay ##ek ' s economic thinking shifted away from socialism and toward the classical liberalism of carl meng ##er after reading von mis ##es ' book socialism . it was sometime after reading socialism that hay ##ek began attending von mis ##es ' private seminars , joining several of his university friends , including fritz mach ##lu ##p , alfred sc ##hu ##tz , felix kaufman ##n , and gottfried ha ##ber ##ler , who were also participating in hay ##ek ' s own , more general , private seminar . it was during this time that he also encountered and befriended noted political philosopher eric vo ##ege ##lin , with whom he retained a long - standing relationship .
sick of hut ##chin ##s ' med ##dling [SEP] in 1950 , hay ##ek left the london school of economics for the university of chicago , where he became a professor in the committee on social thought . hay ##ek ' s salary was funded not by the university , but by an outside foundation . university of chicago president robert hut ##chin ##s was in the midst of a war with the u . of chicago faculty over departmental autonomy and control , and hay ##ek got caught in the middle of that battle . hut ##chin ##s had been attempting to force all departments to adopt the neo - thom ##ist great books program of mortimer adler , and the u . of chicago economists were sick of hut ##chin ##s ' med ##dling . as the result the economics department rejected hut ##chin ##s ' pressure to hire hay ##ek , and hay ##ek became a part of the new committee on social thought .
a virus , bacteria , or parasite [SEP] the most common cause is an infection of the int ##est ##ines due to either a virus , bacteria , or parasite ; a condition known as gas ##tro ##enter ##itis . these infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool , or directly from another person who is infected . it may be divided into three types : short duration watery dia ##rr ##hea , short duration bloody dia ##rr ##hea , and if it lasts for more than two weeks , persistent dia ##rr ##hea . the short duration watery dia ##rr ##hea may be due to an infection by cholera , although this is rare in the developed world . if blood is present it is also known as d ##yse ##nte ##ry . a number of non - infectious causes may also result in dia ##rr ##hea , including hyper ##thy ##roid ##ism , lac ##tose into ##ler ##ance , inflammatory bow ##el disease , a number of medications , and ir ##rita ##ble bow ##el syndrome . in most cases , stool cultures are not required to confirm the exact cause .
if a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt , these can draw water from the body into the bow ##el [SEP] os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bow ##els . if a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt , these can draw water from the body into the bow ##el and cause os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea . os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea can also be the result of mal ##di ##ges ##tion ( e . g . , pan ##cre ##atic disease or coe ##lia ##c disease ) , in which the nutrients are left in the lu ##men to pull in water . or it can be caused by os ##mot ##ic lax ##ative ##s ( which work to alleviate con ##sti ##pati ##on by drawing water into the bow ##els ) . in healthy individuals , too much magnesium or vitamin c or und ##ige ##sted lac ##tose can produce os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea and di ##sten ##tion of the bow ##el . a person who has lac ##tose into ##ler ##ance can have difficulty absorbing lac ##tose after an extra ##ord ##ina ##rily high intake of dairy products . in persons who have fr ##uc ##tose mala ##bs ##or ##ption , excess fr ##uc ##tose intake can also cause dia ##rr ##hea . high - fr ##uc ##tose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorb ##able and less likely to cause dia ##rr ##hea . sugar alcohol ##s such as so ##rb ##ito ##l ( often found in sugar - free foods ) are difficult for the body to absorb and , in large amounts , may lead to os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea . in most of these cases , os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea stops when off ##ending agent ( e . g . milk , so ##rb ##ito ##l ) is stopped .
too much magnesium or vitamin c or und ##ige ##sted lac ##tose [SEP] os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bow ##els . if a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt , these can draw water from the body into the bow ##el and cause os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea . os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea can also be the result of mal ##di ##ges ##tion ( e . g . , pan ##cre ##atic disease or coe ##lia ##c disease ) , in which the nutrients are left in the lu ##men to pull in water . or it can be caused by os ##mot ##ic lax ##ative ##s ( which work to alleviate con ##sti ##pati ##on by drawing water into the bow ##els ) . in healthy individuals , too much magnesium or vitamin c or und ##ige ##sted lac ##tose can produce os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea and di ##sten ##tion of the bow ##el . a person who has lac ##tose into ##ler ##ance can have difficulty absorbing lac ##tose after an extra ##ord ##ina ##rily high intake of dairy products . in persons who have fr ##uc ##tose mala ##bs ##or ##ption , excess fr ##uc ##tose intake can also cause dia ##rr ##hea . high - fr ##uc ##tose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorb ##able and less likely to cause dia ##rr ##hea . sugar alcohol ##s such as so ##rb ##ito ##l ( often found in sugar - free foods ) are difficult for the body to absorb and , in large amounts , may lead to os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea . in most of these cases , os ##mot ##ic dia ##rr ##hea stops when off ##ending agent ( e . g . milk , so ##rb ##ito ##l ) is stopped .
a passive loss of protein - rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids [SEP] inflammatory dia ##rr ##hea occurs when there is damage to the mu ##cos ##al lining or brush border , which leads to a passive loss of protein - rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids . features of all three of the other types of dia ##rr ##hea [ cl ##ari ##fication needed ] can be found in this type of dia ##rr ##hea . it can be caused by bacterial infections , viral infections , parasitic infections , or auto ##im ##mun ##e problems such as inflammatory bow ##el diseases . it can also be caused by tuberculosis , colon cancer , and enter ##itis .

the lack of adequate , available , and affordable medical care . [SEP] poverty is a good indicator of the rate of infectious dia ##rr ##hea in a population . this association does not stem from poverty itself , but rather from the conditions under which impoverished people live . the absence of certain resources compromise ##s the ability of the poor to defend themselves against infectious dia ##rr ##hea .

for health and functioning , including the prevention of infectious dia ##rr ##hea [SEP] proper nutrition is important for health and functioning , including the prevention of infectious dia ##rr ##hea . it is especially important to young children who do not have a fully developed immune system . zinc deficiency , a condition often found in children in developing countries can , even in mild cases , have a significant impact on the development and proper functioning of the human immune system . indeed , this relationship between zinc deficiency reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious dia ##rr ##hea . children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of dia ##rr ##hea , severe dia ##rr ##hea , and dia ##rr ##hea associated with fever . similarly , vitamin a deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of dia ##rr ##hea ##l episodes , however there is some disc ##re ##pan ##cy when it comes to the impact of vitamin a deficiency on the rate of disease . while some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin a status , others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency . given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin a def ##icient , this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction .
caused people to stay fever ##ish twice as long as those not so treated . [SEP] according to two researchers , ness ##e and williams , dia ##rr ##hea may function as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism . as a result , if it is stopped , there might be a delay in recovery . they cite in support of this argument research published in 1973 that found that treating shi ##gel ##la with the anti - dia ##rr ##hea drug ( co - ph ##eno ##tro ##pe , lo ##mot ##il ) caused people to stay fever ##ish twice as long as those not so treated . the researchers indeed themselves observed that : " lo ##mot ##il may be contra ##ind ##icated in shi ##gel ##los ##is . dia ##rr ##hea may represent a defense mechanism " .
access to soap and water is limited [SEP] basic sanitation techniques can have a profound effect on the transmission of dia ##rr ##hea ##l disease . the implementation of hand washing using soap and water , for example , has been experimental ##ly shown to reduce the incidence of disease by approximately 42 – 48 % . hand washing in developing countries , however , is compromised by poverty as acknowledged by the cdc : " hand ##wash ##ing is integral to disease prevention in all parts of the world ; however , access to soap and water is limited in a number of less developed countries . this lack of access is one of many challenges to proper hygiene in less developed countries . " solutions to this barrier require the implementation of educational programs that encourage sanitary behaviour ##s .
a too rich solution in the gut draws water from the rest of the body , just as if the person were to drink sea water [SEP] drinks especially high in simple sugar ##s , such as soft drinks and fruit juice ##s , are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase de ##hy ##dra ##tion . a too rich solution in the gut draws water from the rest of the body , just as if the person were to drink sea water . plain water may be used if more specific and effective or ##t preparations are unavailable or are not pal ##atable . additionally , a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person , with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall . a nas ##oga ##st ##ric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warrant ##ed .
children whose food is restricted have dia ##rr ##hea of longer duration and recover int ##estinal function more slowly [SEP] who recommends a child with dia ##rr ##hea continue to be fed . continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal int ##estinal function . in contrast , children whose food is restricted have dia ##rr ##hea of longer duration and recover int ##estinal function more slowly . a child should also continue to be breast ##fed . the who states " food should never be with ##held and the child ' s usual foods should not be dil ##uted . breast ##fe ##eding should always be continued . " and in the specific example of cholera , cdc also makes the same recommendation . in young children who are not breast - fed and live in the developed world , a lac ##tose - free diet may be useful to speed recovery .
provide them with education and training [SEP] people of all ages attend , and many often move on to becoming imam ##s . [ citation needed ] the certificate of an ʻ ##ali ##m , for example , requires approximately twelve years of study . [ citation needed ] a good number of the huff ##az ( plural of ha ##fi ##z ) are the product of the mad ##aris . the mad ##aris also resemble colleges , where people take evening classes and reside in dorm ##itor ##ies . an important function of the mad ##aris is to admit orphans and poor children in order to provide them with education and training . mad ##aris may enroll female students ; however , they study separately from the men .

their desire for religious knowledge [SEP] according to the sunni scholar ibn ʻ ##asa ##kir in the 12th century , there were opportunities for female education in the medieval islamic world , writing that women could study , earn i ##ja ##za ##hs ( academic degrees ) , and qualify as scholars and teachers . this was especially the case for learned and scholarly families , who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters . ibn ʻ ##asa ##kir had himself studied under 80 different female teachers in his time . female education in the islamic world was inspired by muhammad ' s wives , such as k ##had ##ija ##h , a successful business ##woman . according to a had ##ith attributed to muhammad , he praised the women of medina because of their desire for religious knowledge :
confirm the doctrines of islam [SEP] although ottoman mad ##aris had a number of different branches of study , such as call ##ig ##raphic sciences , oral sciences , and intellectual sciences , they primarily served the function of an islamic centre for spiritual learning . " the goal of all knowledge and in particular , of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of god . " religion , for the most part , determines the significance and importance of each science . as ina ##lc ##ı ##k mentions : " those which aid religion are good and sciences like astro ##logy are bad . " however , even though mathematics , or studies in logic were part of the madras ##a ' s curriculum , they were all centred around religion . even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings . " the ul ##ema of the ottoman med ##res ##es held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths " – key word being " divine " . ina ##lc ##ı ##k also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of islam . " hence , mad ##aris – schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the ottoman world . although scholars such as go ##ff ##man have argued that the ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a plural ##istic society , it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact he ##ft ##ily religious and were not religious ##ly plural ##istic , but centred around islam . similarly , in europe " jewish children learned the hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home , and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the torah . " wi ##es ##ner - hank ##s also says that protestants also wanted to teach " proper religious values . " this shows that in the early modern period , ottomans and europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on . thus , ottoman mad ##aris were very similar to present day schools in the sense that they offered a wide range of studies ; however , these studies , in their ultimate objective , aimed to further solid ##ify and consolidate islamic practices and theories .
proximity to latin america [SEP] several large companies are headquartered in or around miami , including but not limited to : ak ##erman sent ##er ##fi ##tt , alien ##ware , ar ##qui ##tec ##tonic ##a , arrow air , ba ##card ##i , ben ##ih ##ana , bright ##star corporation , burger king , celebrity cruises , carnival corporation , carnival cruise lines , crisp ##in porter + bog ##us ##ky , du ##any plate ##r - z ##y ##ber ##k & company , es ##pi ##rito santo financial group , fi ##z ##ber . com , greenberg tr ##aur ##ig , holland & knight , ink ##tel direct , interval international , len ##nar , navarro discount ph ##arm ##acies , norwegian cruise lines , oceania cruises , perry ellis international , rc ##tv international , royal caribbean cruise lines , ryder systems , sea ##bour ##n cruise line , sedan ##o ' s , tel ##ef ##onic ##a usa , un ##ima ##s , tel ##em ##und ##o , un ##ivision , u . s . century bank , vector group and world fuel services . because of its proximity to latin america , miami serves as the headquarters of latin american operations for more than 1400 multinational corporations , including ai ##g , american airlines , cisco , disney , ex ##xon , fed ##ex , kraft foods , leo ph ##arm ##a americas , microsoft , yahoo , oracle , sb ##c communications , sony , sy ##man ##tec , visa international , and wal - mart .
tropical weather [SEP] miami ' s tropical weather allows for year - round outdoors activities . the city has numerous marina ##s , rivers , bays , canals , and the atlantic ocean , which make boating , sailing , and fishing popular outdoors activities . bis ##ca ##yne bay has numerous coral reefs which make s ##nor ##kel ##ing and scuba diving popular . there are over 80 parks and gardens in the city . the largest and most popular parks are bay ##front park and bi ##cent ##ennial park ( located in the heart of downtown and the location of the american airlines arena and bays ##ide marketplace ) , tropical park , peacock park , mornings ##ide park , virginia key , and watson island .
the great famine [SEP] these immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in north america in 1835 , in which workers in the city won the ten - hour work ##day . the city was a destination for thousands of irish immigrants fleeing the great famine in the 1840s ; housing for them was developed south of south street , and was later occupied by succeeding immigrants . they established a network of catholic churches and schools , and dominated the catholic clergy for decades . anti - irish , anti - catholic nat ##ivist riots had erupted in philadelphia in 1844 . in the latter half of the century , immigrants from russia , eastern europe and italy ; and african americans from the southern u . s . settled in the city . between 1880 and 1930 , the african - american population of philadelphia increased from 31 , 69 ##9 to 219 , 55 ##9 . twentieth - century black newcomers were part of the great migration out of the rural south to northern and midwest ##ern industrial cities .
the loss of many middle - class union jobs [SEP] in 1940 , non - hispanic whites constituted 86 . 8 % of the city ' s population . the population peaked at more than two million residents in 1950 , then began to decline with the restructuring of industry , which led to the loss of many middle - class union jobs . in addition , suburban ##ization had been drawing off many of the wealth ##ier residents to outlying railroad com ##mut ##ing towns and newer housing . rev ##ital ##ization and gen ##tri ##fication of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century , with much of the development in the center city and university city areas of the city . after many of the old manufacturers and businesses left philadelphia or shut down , the city started attracting service businesses and began to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination . glass - and - granite skyscraper ##s were built in center city . historic areas such as independence national historical park located in old city and society hill were renovated during the reform ##ist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s . they are now among the most desirable living areas of center city . this has slowed the city ' s 40 - year population decline after it lost nearly one - quarter of its population .
philadelphia was chosen as the host city for the first republican national convention in 1856 [SEP] from the american civil war until the mid - 20th century , philadelphia was a bastion of the republican party , which arose from the staunch pro - northern views of philadelphia residents during and after the war ( philadelphia was chosen as the host city for the first republican national convention in 1856 ) . after the great depression , democratic registration ##s increased , but the city was not carried by democrat franklin d . roosevelt in his landslide victory of 1932 ( in which pennsylvania was one of the few states won by republican herbert hoover ) . four years later , however , voter turnout surged and the city finally flipped to the democrats . roosevelt carried philadelphia with over 60 % of the vote in 1936 . the city has remained loyal ##ly democratic in every presidential election since . it is now one of the most democratic in the country ; in 2008 , democrat barack obama drew 83 % of the city ' s vote . obama ' s win was even greater in 2012 , capturing 85 % of the vote .
lack of funding [SEP] in 1981 , large sections of the sept ##a regional rail service to the far suburbs of philadelphia were discontinued due to lack of funding . several projects have been proposed to extend rail service back to these areas , but lack of funding has again been the chief obstacle to implementation . these projects include the proposed sc ##hu ##yl ##kill valley metro to w ##yo ##mis ##sing , pa , and extension of the media / el ##wyn line back to wa ##wa , pa . sept ##a ' s airport regional rail line regional rail offers direct service to the philadelphia international airport .
for peace and justice , and to try and make this country wake up once and for all [SEP] on april 22 , 1971 , kerry appeared before a u . s . senate committee hearing on proposals relating to ending the war . the day after this testimony , kerry participated in a demonstration with thousands of other veterans in which he and other vietnam war veterans threw their medals and service ribbons over a fence erected at the front steps of the united states capitol building to drama ##ti ##ze their opposition to the war . jack smith , a marine , read a statement explaining why the veterans were returning their military awards to the government . for more than two hours , almost 1000 angry veterans tossed their medals , ribbons , hats , jackets , and military papers over the fence . each veteran gave his or her name , hometown , branch of service and a statement . kerry threw some of his own decorations and awards as well as some given to him by other veterans to throw . as kerry threw his decorations over the fence , his statement was : " i ' m not doing this for any violent reasons , but for peace and justice , and to try and make this country wake up once and for all . "
tried to camp on the village green [SEP] kerry was arrested on may 30 , 1971 , during a v ##va ##w march to honor american pow ##s held captive by north vietnam . the march was planned as a multi - day event from concord to boston , and while in lexington , participants tried to camp on the village green . at 2 : 30 a . m . , local and state police arrested 441 demonstrators , including kerry , for tres ##pass ##ing . all were given the miranda warning and were hauled away on school buses to spend the night at the lexington public works garage . kerry and the other protesters later paid a $ 5 fine , and were released . the mass arrests caused a community backlash and ended up giving positive coverage to the v ##va ##w .
to become under - secretary - general for political and general assembly affairs at the united nations [SEP] in 1970 , kerry had considered running for congress in the democratic primary against hawk ##ish democrat philip j . phil ##bin of massachusetts ' s 3rd congressional district , but def ##erre ##d in favour of robert dr ##ina ##n , a jesuit priest and anti - war activist , who went on to defeat phil ##bin . in february 1972 , kerry ' s wife bought a house in worcester , with kerry intending to run against the 4th district ' s age ##ing thirteen - term incumbent democrat , harold don ##oh ##ue . the couple never moved in . after republican congressman f . bradford morse of the neighbouring 5th district announced his retirement and then resignation to become under - secretary - general for political and general assembly affairs at the united nations . the couple instead rented an apartment in lowell , so that kerry could run to succeed him .
they had received an anonymous call warning that the kerry lines would be cut [SEP] including kerry , the democratic primary race had 10 candidates , including attorney paul j . she ##eh ##y , state representative anthony r . di ##fr ##us ##cia , john j . desmond and robert b . kennedy . kerry ran a " very expensive , sophisticated campaign " , financed by out - of - state back ##ers and supported by many young volunteers . di ##fr ##us ##cia ' s campaign headquarters shared the same building as kerry ' s . on the eve of the september 19 primary , police found kerry ' s younger brother cameron and campaign field director thomas j . valle ##ly , breaking into where the building ' s telephone lines were located . they were arrested and charged with " breaking and entering with the intent to commit grand la ##rce ##ny " , but the charges were dropped a year later . at the time of the incident , di ##fr ##us ##cia alleged that the two were trying to disrupt his get - out - the vote efforts . valle ##ly and cameron kerry maintained that they were only checking their own telephone lines because they had received an anonymous call warning that the kerry lines would be cut .
" miss ##tate ##ments " in his first divorce trial [SEP] in january 1977 , drone ##y promoted him to first assistant district attorney , essentially making kerry his campaign and media sur ##rogate because drone ##y was af ##flict ##ed with amy ##ot ##rop ##hic lateral sc ##ler ##osis ( als , or lou ge ##hri ##g ' s disease ) . as first assistant , kerry tried cases , which included winning convictions in a high - profile rape case and a murder . he also played a role in administering the office , including initiating the creation of special white - collar and organized crime units , creating programs to address the problems of rape and other crime victims and witnesses , and managing trial calendar ##s to reflect case priorities . it was in this role in 1978 that kerry announced an investigation into possible criminal charges against then senator edward brooke , regarding " miss ##tate ##ments " in his first divorce trial . the inquiry ended with no charges being brought after investigators and prosecutors determined that brooke ' s miss ##tate ##ments were per ##tine ##nt to the case , but were not material enough to have affected the outcome .
for the iraq war [SEP] during his bid to be elected president in 2004 , kerry frequently criticized president george w . bush for the iraq war . while kerry had initially voted in support of author ##izing president bush to use force in dealing with saddam hussein , he voted against an $ 87 billion supplemental appropriations bill to pay for the subsequent war . his statement on march 16 , 2004 , " i actually did vote for the $ 87 billion before i voted against it , " helped the bush campaign to paint him as a flip - flop ##per and has been cited as contributing to kerry ' s defeat .
a pol ##itic ##ized confirmation process following criticism of her response to the 2012 ben ##gh ##azi attack [SEP] on december 15 , 2012 , several news outlets reported that president barack obama would nominate kerry to succeed hillary clinton as secretary of state , after susan rice , widely seen as obama ' s preferred choice , withdrew her name from consideration citing a pol ##itic ##ized confirmation process following criticism of her response to the 2012 ben ##gh ##azi attack . on december 21 , obama proposed the nomination which received positive commentary . his confirmation hearing took place on january 24 , 2013 , before the senate foreign relations committee , the same panel where he first testified in 1971 . the committee unanimously voted to approve him on january 29 , 2013 , and the same day the full senate confirmed him on a vote of 94 – 3 . in a letter to massachusetts governor dev ##al patrick , kerry announced his resignation from the senate effective february 1 .
po ##achi ##ng and negligence [SEP] ran ##tham ##bor ##e national park is known worldwide for its tiger population and is considered by both wilderness lovers and photographers as one of the best place in india to spot tigers . at one point , due to po ##achi ##ng and negligence , tigers became extinct at sar ##isk ##a , but five tigers have been relocated there . prominent among the wildlife san ##ct ##uaries are mount abu sanctuary , b ##hen ##sr ##od ga ##rh sanctuary , dar ##rah sanctuary , jai ##sam ##and sanctuary , ku ##mb ##hal ##garh wildlife sanctuary , jaw ##aha ##r saga ##r sanctuary , and sit ##a mata wildlife sanctuary .
guam was captured by the japanese [SEP] before world war ii , guam and three other territories – american samoa , hawaii , and the philippines – were the only american jurisdictions in the pacific ocean . on december 7 , 1941 , hours after the attack on pearl harbor , guam was captured by the japanese , and was occupied for thirty months . during the occupation , guam ##anian ##s were subjected to culture alignment , forced labor , be ##head ##ings , rape , and torture . guam endured hostilities when american forces recaptured the island on july 21 , 1944 ; liberation day commemorates the victory . since the 1960s , the economy is supported by two industries : tourism and the united states armed forces .
spanish – american war [SEP] the united states took control of the island in the 1898 spanish – american war , as part of the treaty of paris . guam was transferred to u . s . navy control on 23 december 1898 by executive order 108 - a . guam came to serve as a station for american ships traveling to and from the philippines , while the northern mariana islands passed to germany , and then to japan . a u . s . navy yard was established at pit ##i in 1899 , and a marine barracks at sum ##ay in 1901 . : 13 following the philippine – american war , emilio ag ##uin ##aldo and ap ##olin ##ario mab ##ini were exiled on guam in 1901 . : vi
to serve as interpreter ##s [SEP] the northern mariana islands had become a japanese protectorate before the war . it was the cha ##mo ##rro ##s from the northern mariana ##s who were brought to guam to serve as interpreter ##s and in other capacities for the occupying japanese force . the guam ##anian cha ##mo ##rro ##s were treated as an occupied enemy by the japanese military . after the war , this would cause resentment between the guam ##anian cha ##mo ##rro ##s and the cha ##mo ##rro ##s of the northern mariana ##s . guam ' s cha ##mo ##rro ##s believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them , whereas having been occupied for over 30 years , the northern mariana cha ##mo ##rro ##s were loyal to japan .
would give it a level of self - government similar to puerto rico [SEP] in the 1980s and early 1990s , there was a significant movement in favor of the territory becoming a commonwealth , which would give it a level of self - government similar to puerto rico and the northern mariana islands . however , the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of guam proposed , due to it having clauses incompatible with the territorial clause ( art . iv , sec . 3 , cl . 2 ) of the u . s . constitution . other movements advocate u . s . statehood for guam , union with the state of hawaii , union with the northern mariana islands as a single territory , or independence .
most products must be shipped into guam for consumers [SEP] the commercial port of guam is the island ' s life ##line because most products must be shipped into guam for consumers . it receives the weekly calls of the hawaii - based shipping line mats ##on , inc . whose container ships connect guam with honolulu , hawaii , los angeles , california , oakland , california and seattle , washington . the port is also the regional trans ##hip ##ment hub for over 500 , 000 customers throughout the micro ##nesian region . the port is the shipping and receiving point for containers designated for the island ' s u . s . department of defense installations , andersen air force base and commander , naval forces mariana ##s and eventually the third marine expeditionary force .
sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the fen ##a lake reservoir and u ##gum river [SEP] wild ##fires plague the forested areas of guam every dry season despite the island ' s humid climate . most fires are man - caused with 80 % resulting from arson . po ##ache ##rs often start fires to attract deer to the new growth . invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas . grasslands and " barren ##s " have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion . during the rainy season sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the fen ##a lake reservoir and u ##gum river , leading to water quality problems for southern guam . eroded si ##lt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island . soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers ( planting trees ) have had little success in preserving natural habitats .
because it has repeatedly done so in the past [SEP] hume maintained that all knowledge , even the most basic beliefs about the natural world , cannot be con ##clusive ##ly established by reason . rather , he maintained , our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits , developed in response to accumulated sense experiences . among his many arguments hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction . hume argued that it requires ind ##uc ##tive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of ind ##uc ##tive reasoning , and therefore the justification for ind ##uc ##tive reasoning is a circular argument . among hume ' s conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past . thus , as a simple instance posed by hume , we cannot know with certainty by ind ##uc ##tive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the east , but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past .
less self - determining [SEP] in his science of logic ( 1812 – 1814 ) he ##gel argues that finite qualities are not fully " real " because they depend on other finite qualities to determine them . qu ##ali ##tative infinity , on the other hand , would be more self - determining and hence more fully real . similarly finite natural things are less " real " — because they are less self - determining — than spiritual things like morally responsible people , ethical communities and god . so any doctrine , such as material ##ism , that asserts that finite qualities or natural objects are fully real is mistaken .
we are finite beings [SEP] in addition , he ##gel does believe we can know the structure of god ' s mind , or ultimate reality . he ##gel agrees with ki ##er ##ke ##gaard that both reality and humans are incomplete , ina ##sm ##uch as we are in time , and reality develops through time . but the relation between time and eternity is outside time and this is the " logical structure " that he ##gel thinks we can know . ki ##er ##ke ##gaard disputes this assertion , because it eliminate ##s the clear distinction between onto ##logy and ep ##iste ##mology . existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence . thought is always a form of abstraction , and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think , but all forms in existence are un ##thi ##nka ##ble ; thought depends on language , which merely abstracts from experience , thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings . in addition , because we are finite beings , we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as god , so we cannot know god exists , since that which trans ##cend ##s time simultaneously trans ##cend ##s human understanding .
resentment against the former soviet union [SEP] the languages have not undergone the deliberate highlighting of minor linguistic differences in the name of nationalism as has occurred in the bosnian , serbian and croatian standards of serb ##o - croatian . however , most slavic languages ( including czech ) have been distance ##d in this way from russian influences because of widespread public resentment against the former soviet union ( which occupied czechoslovakia in 1968 ) . czech and slovak form a dialect continuum , with great similarity between neighboring czech and slovak dialects . ( see " dialects " below . )
the similarities [SEP] the similarities between czech and slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th - century scholars who called themselves " czech ##oslav ##s " ( ce ##cho ##sl ##ova ##ci ) , believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded german bohemian ##s and ( to a lesser extent ) hungarians and other sl ##avs . during the first czechoslovak republic ( 1918 – 1938 ) , although " czechoslovak " was designated as the republic ' s official language both czech and slovak written standards were used . standard written slovak was partially modeled on literary czech , and czech was preferred for some official functions in the slovak half of the republic . czech influence on slovak was protested by slovak scholars , and when slovakia broke off from czechoslovakia in 1938 as the slovak state ( which then aligned with nazi germany in world war ii ) literary slovak was deliberately distance ##d from czech . when the axis powers lost the war and czechoslovakia reformed , slovak developed somewhat on its own ( with czech influence ) ; during the prague spring of 1968 , slovak gained independence from ( and equality with ) czech . since then , " czechoslovak " refers to improvised pi ##d ##gins of the languages which have arise ##n from the decrease in mutual intel ##li ##gi ##bility .
inverted [SEP] czech syntax has a subject – verb – object sentence structure . in practice , however , word order is flexible and used for topical ##ization and focus . although czech has a per ##ip ##hra ##stic passive construction ( like english ) , col ##lo ##qui ##al word - order changes frequently produce the passive voice . for example , to change " peter killed paul " to " paul was killed by peter " the order of subject and object is inverted : pet ##r za ##bil pa ##v ##la ( " peter killed paul " ) becomes " paul , peter killed " ( pa ##v ##la za ##bil pet ##r ) . pa ##v ##la is in the acc ##usa ##tive case , the grammatical object ( in this case , the victim ) of the verb .
church established cathedral schools [SEP] after the fall of rome , the catholic church became the sole preserve ##r of liter ##ate scholarship in western europe . the church established cathedral schools in the early middle ages as centers of advanced education . some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and fore ##be ##ars of many of europe ' s modern universities . during the high middle ages , chart ##res cathedral operated the famous and influential chart ##res cathedral school . the medieval universities of western christ ##end ##om were well - integrated across all of western europe , encouraged freedom of inquiry , and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers , including thomas a ##quin ##as of the university of naples , robert gross ##ete ##ste of the university of oxford , an early expo ##sitor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation , and saint albert the great , a pioneer of biological field research . founded in 108 ##8 , the university of bo ##log ##ne is considered the first , and the oldest continually operating university .
rise of large corporations and advancing technology [SEP] secondary education in the united states did not emerge until 1910 , with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories , which required skilled workers . in order to meet this new job demand , high schools were created , with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work . this proved beneficial for both employers and employees , since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer , while skilled employees received a higher wages .
the educational establishment itself occasionally showers the person with criticism rather than gratitude [SEP] some claim that there is education inequality because children did not exceed the education of their parents . this education inequality is then associated with income inequality . although critical thinking is a goal of education , criticism and blame are often the un ##int ##ended by products of our current educational process . students often blame their teachers and their textbooks , despite the availability of libraries and the internet . when someone tries to improve education , the educational establishment itself occasionally showers the person with criticism rather than gratitude . better by products of an educational system would be gratitude and determination .
commercial formula , rock convention and self - parody [SEP] the term " post - punk " was first used by journalists in the late 1970s to describe groups moving beyond punk ' s sonic template into di ##spar ##ate areas . many of these artists , initially inspired by punk ' s di ##y et ##hic and energy , ultimately became di ##sil ##lusion ##ed with the style and movement , feeling that it had fallen into commercial formula , rock convention and self - parody . they rep ##udi ##ated its pop ##uli ##st claims to accessibility and raw simplicity , instead seeing an opportunity to break with musical tradition , sub ##vert commonplace ##s and challenge audiences . artists moved beyond ##s punk ' s focus on the concerns of a largely white , male , working class population and abandoned its continued reliance on established rock and roll tr ##ope ##s , such as three - chord progression ##s and chuck berry - based guitar riff ##s . these artists instead defined punk as " an imperative to constant change " , believing that " radical content demands radical form " .
anti - corp ##ora ##tist [SEP] nicholas le ##zard described post - punk as " a fusion of art and music " . the era saw the robust app ##ropriation of ideas from literature , art , cinema , philosophy , politics and critical theory into musical and pop cultural contexts . artists sought to refuse the common distinction between high and low culture and returned to the art school tradition found in the work of artists such as captain beef ##heart and david bowie . among major influences on a variety of post - punk artists were writers such as william s . burroughs and j . g . ballard , avant - garde political scenes such as situation ##ism and dad ##a , and intellectual movements such as post ##mo ##dern ##ism . many artists viewed their work in explicitly political terms . additionally , in some locations , the creation of post - punk music was closely linked to the development of e ##ffi ##ca ##cious sub ##culture ##s , which played important roles in the production of art , multimedia performances , fan ##zine ##s and independent labels related to the music . many post - punk artists maintained an anti - corp ##ora ##tist approach to recording and instead seized on alternate means of producing and releasing music . journalists also became an important element of the culture , and popular music magazines and critics became immersed in the movement .
multi ##far ##ious [SEP] the scope of the term " post - punk " has been subject to controversy . while some critics , such as allmusic ' s stephen thomas er ##le ##wine , have employed the term " post - punk " to denote " a more adventurous and art ##y form of punk " , others have suggested it per ##tain ##s to a set of artistic sen ##si ##bilities and approaches rather than any un ##ifying style . music journalist and post - punk scholar simon reynolds has advocated that post - punk be conceived as " less a genre of music than a space of possibility " , suggesting that " what unite ##s all this activity is a set of open - ended imperative ##s : innovation ; will ##ful odd ##ness ; the will ##ful jett ##ison ##ing of all things precedent ##ed or ' rock ' n ' roll ' " . nicholas le ##zard , problem ##ati ##zing the cat ##ego ##rization of post - punk as a genre , described the movement as " so multi ##far ##ious that only the broad ##est use of the term is possible " .
various groups commonly labeled post - punk in fact pre ##date the punk rock movement [SEP] generally , post - punk music is defined as music that emerged from the cultural mil ##ieu of punk rock in the late 1970s , although many groups now categorized as post - punk were initially sub ##sume ##d under the broad umbrella of punk or new wave music , only becoming differentiated as the terms came to sign ##ify more narrow styles . additionally , the accuracy of the term ' s chronological prefix " post " has been disputed , as various groups commonly labeled post - punk in fact pre ##date the punk rock movement . reynolds defined the post - punk era as occurring loosely between 1978 and 1984 .

france was deprived of many of its colonies [SEP] the war was successful for great britain , which gained the bulk of new france in north america , spanish florida , some individual caribbean islands in the west indies , the colony of senegal on the west african coast , and superiority over the french trading outpost ##s on the indian subcontinent . the native american tribes were excluded from the settlement ; a subsequent conflict , known as pontiac ' s war , was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre - war status . in europe , the war began disastrous ##ly for prussia , but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw king frederick the great manage to retrieve the prussian position and retain the status quo ant ##e bell ##um . prussia emerged as a new european great power . although austria failed to retrieve the territory of silesia from prussia ( its original goal ) its military prowess was also noted by the other powers . the involvement of portugal , spain and sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers . france was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddle ##d itself with heavy war debts that its in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt financial system could barely handle . spain lost florida but gained french louisiana and regained control of its colonies , e . g . , cuba and the philippines , which had been captured by the british during the war . france and other european powers avenge ##d their defeat in 1778 when the american revolutionary war broke out , with hopes of destroying britain ' s dominance once and for all .
the dutch republic , long - time british ally , kept its neutrality intact , fearing the odds against britain and prussia fighting the great powers of europe [SEP] many middle and small powers in europe , unlike in the previous wars , tried to steer clear away from the es ##cala ##ting conflict , even though they had interests in the conflict or with the bell ##iger ##ents , like denmark - norway . the dutch republic , long - time british ally , kept its neutrality intact , fearing the odds against britain and prussia fighting the great powers of europe , even tried to prevent britain ' s domination in india . naples , sicily , and savoy , although sided with franco - spanish party , declined to join the coalition under the fear of british power . the taxation needed for war caused the russian people considerable hardship , being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by empress elizabeth in 1759 to complete her addition to the winter palace . like sweden , russia concluded a separate peace with prussia .

france was very much interested in colonial expansion and was willing to exploit the vulnerability of hanover in war against great britain [SEP] the hanover ##ian king george ii of great britain was passionate ##ly devoted to his family ’ s continental holdings , but his commitments in germany were counter ##balance ##d by the demands of the british colonies overseas . if war against france for colonial expansion was to be resumed , then hanover had to be secured against franco - prussian attack . france was very much interested in colonial expansion and was willing to exploit the vulnerability of hanover in war against great britain , but it had no desire to divert forces to central europe for prussia ' s interest .
best ##hu ##ze ##v , assuming the preparation was directed against prussia , [SEP] years later , ka ##uni ##tz kept trying to establish france ' s alliance with austria . he tried as hard as he could for austria to not get en ##tangled in hanover ' s political affairs , and was even willing to trade austrian netherlands for france ' s aid in rec ##ap ##turing silesia . frustrated by this decision and by the dutch republic ' s insistence on neutrality , britain soon turned to russia . on september 30 , 1755 , britain pledged financial aid to russia in order to station 50 , 000 troops on the liv ##onia ##n - lit ##hun ##ian border , so they could defend britain ' s interests in hanover immediately . best ##hu ##ze ##v , assuming the preparation was directed against prussia , was more than happy to obey the request of the british . un ##bek ##now ##nst to the other powers , king george ii also made overture ##s to the prussian king ; frederick , who began fearing the austro - russian intentions , and was excited to welcome a rap ##pro ##che ##ment with britain . on january 16 , 1756 , the convention of westminster was signed wherein britain and prussia promised to aid one another in order to achieve lasting peace and stability in europe .
france was so enraged , and terrified , by the sudden betrayal of its only ally . austria , [SEP] the carefully coded word in the agreement proved no less catalytic for the other european powers . the results were absolute chaos . empress elizabeth of russia was outraged at the du ##plicity of britain ' s position . not only that france was so enraged , and terrified , by the sudden betrayal of its only ally . austria , particularly ka ##uni ##tz , used this situation to their utmost advantage . the now - isolated france was forced to acc ##ede to the austro - russian alliance or face ruin . thereafter , on may 1 , 1756 , the first treaty of versailles was signed , in which both nations pledged 24 . 000 troops to defend each other in the case of an attack . this diplomatic revolution proved to be an important cause of the war ; although both treaties were self - defensive in nature , the actions of both coalition ##s made the war virtually inevitable .
several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative [SEP] for much of the eighteenth century , france approached its wars in the same way . it would let colonies defend themselves or would offer only minimal help ( sending them limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers ) , anticipating that fights for the colonies would most likely be lost anyway . this strategy was to a degree forced upon france : geography , coupled with the superiority of the british navy , made it difficult for the french navy to provide significant supplies and support to french colonies . similarly , several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any french ruler . given these military nec ##ess ##ities , the french government , un ##sur ##pr ##ising ##ly , based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in europe : it would keep most of its army on the continent , hoping for victories closer to home . the plan was to fight to the end of hostilities and then , in treaty negotiations , to trade territorial acquisitions in europe to regain lost overseas possessions . this approach did not serve france well in the war , as the colonies were indeed lost , but although much of the european war went well , by its end france had few counter ##bala ##nc ##ing european successes .
saxon army surrendered in october 1756 , and was forcibly incorporated into the prussian army [SEP] the saxon and austrian armies were un ##pre ##par ##ed , and their forces were scattered . frederick occupied dresden with little or no opposition from the saxons . at the battle of lo ##bos ##itz on 1 october 1756 , frederick prevented the isolated saxon army from being reinforced by an austrian army under general browne . the prussian ##s then occupied saxony ; after the siege of pi ##rna , the saxon army surrendered in october 1756 , and was forcibly incorporated into the prussian army . the attack on neutral saxony caused outrage across europe and led to the strengthening of the anti - prussian coalition . the only significant austrian success was the partial occupation of silesia . far from being easy , frederick ' s early successes proved ind ##ec ##isi ##ve and very costly for prussia ' s smaller army . this led him to remark that he did not fight the same austrians as he had during the previous war .
the dutch wished to remain fully neutral [SEP] britain had been surprised by the sudden prussian offensive but now began shipping supplies and ₤ ##6 ##70 , 000 ( equivalent to ₤ ##8 ##9 . 9 million in 2015 ) to its new ally . a combined force of allied german states was organised by the british to protect hanover from french invasion , under the command of the duke of cumberland . the british attempted to persuade the dutch republic to join the alliance , but the request was rejected , as the dutch wished to remain fully neutral . despite the huge di ##spar ##ity in numbers , the year had been successful for the prussian - led forces on the continent , in contrast to disappointing british campaigns in north america .
frederick took 5 , 000 troops from the siege at prague and sent them to reinforce the 19 , 000 - man army under the duke of brunswick - be ##vern at ko ##lin in bohemia [SEP] in early 1757 , frederick ii again took the initiative by marching into the kingdom of bohemia , hoping to in ##flict a decisive defeat on austrian forces . after winning the bloody battle of prague on 6 may 1757 , in which both forces suffered major casualties , the prussian ##s forced the austrians back into the fortifications of prague . the prussian army then laid siege to the city . following the battle at prague , frederick took 5 , 000 troops from the siege at prague and sent them to reinforce the 19 , 000 - man army under the duke of brunswick - be ##vern at ko ##lin in bohemia . austrian marshal da ##un arrived too late to participate in the battle of prague , but picked up 16 , 000 men who had escaped from the battle . with this army he slowly moved to relieve prague . the prussian army was too weak to simultaneously be ##sie ##ge prague and keep da ##un away , and frederick was forced to attack prepared positions . the resulting battle of ko ##lin was a sharp defeat for frederick , his first military defeat . his losses further forced him to lift the siege and withdraw from bohemia altogether .
defeated a smaller prussian force [SEP] later that summer , the russians invaded me ##mel with 75 , 000 troops . me ##mel had one of the strongest fortress ##es in prussia . however , after five days of artillery bombardment the russian army was able to storm it . the russians then used me ##mel as a base to invade east prussia and defeated a smaller prussian force in the fiercely contested battle of gross - ja ##gers ##dorf on 30 august 1757 . however , it was not yet able to take ko ##nig ##sberg and retreated soon afterward . still , it was a new threat to prussia . not only was frederick forced to break off his invasion of bohemia , he was now forced to withdraw further into prussian - controlled territory . his defeats on the battlefield brought still more op ##port ##uni ##st nations into the war . sweden declared war on prussia and invaded pomerania with 17 , 000 men . sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy pomerania and felt the swedish army would not need to engage with the prussian ##s because the prussian ##s were occupied on so many other fronts .
calculating that no further russian advance was likely until 1758 [SEP] calculating that no further russian advance was likely until 1758 , frederick moved the bulk of his eastern forces to pomerania under the command of marshal le ##hwa ##ld ##t where they were to rep ##el the swedish invasion . in short order , the prussian army drove the sw ##edes back , occupied most of swedish pomerania , and blockade ##d its capital st ##ral ##sund . george ii of great britain , on the advice of his british ministers , revoked the convention of k ##los ##ter ##ze ##ven , and hanover re ##enter ##ed the war . over the winter the new commander of the hanover ##ian forces , duke ferdinand of brunswick , reg ##roup ##ed his army and launched a series of offensive ##s that drove the french back across the river rhine . the british had suffered further defeats in north america , particularly at fort william henry . at home , however , stability had been established . since 1756 , successive governments led by newcastle and pitt had fallen . in august 1757 , the two men agreed to a political partnership and formed a coalition government that gave new , firm ##er direction to the war effort . the new strategy emphasis ##ed both newcastle ' s commitment to british involvement on the continent , particularly in defence of germany , and william pitt ' s determination to use naval power to seize french colonies around the globe . this " dual strategy " would dominate british policy for the next five years .
re - captured the port of em ##den in march 1758 before crossing the rhine with his own forces [SEP] in april 1758 , the british concluded the anglo - prussian convention with frederick in which they committed to pay him an annual subsidy of £ ##6 ##70 , 000 . britain also dispatched 9 , 000 troops to reinforce ferdinand ' s hanover ##ian army , the first british troop commitment on the continent and a reversal in the policy of pitt . ferdinand had succeeded in driving the french from hanover and westphalia and re - captured the port of em ##den in march 1758 before crossing the rhine with his own forces , which caused alarm in france . despite ferdinand ' s victory over the french at the battle of k ##re ##feld and the brief occupation of dusseldorf , he was compelled by the successful man ##oe ##uve ##ring of larger french forces to withdraw across the rhine .

he suffered very heavy casualties , and the austrians retreated in good order . [SEP] despite this , the austrians , under the command of general lau ##don , captured g ##lat ##z ( now k ##ł ##od ##zko , poland ) in silesia . in the battle of lie ##gni ##tz frederick scored a strong victory despite being outnumbered three to one . the russians under general salty ##kov and austrians under general lacy briefly occupied his capital , berlin , in october , but could not hold it for long . the end of that year saw frederick once more victorious , defeating the able da ##un in the battle of tor ##gau ; but he suffered very heavy casualties , and the austrians retreated in good order .
a french force of 10 , 000 from brest to catch up with him and open fire on the re ##em ##bar ##kat ##ion troops [SEP] the troops were re ##em ##bar ##ked and moved to the bay of st . luna ##ire in brittany where , on 3 september , they were landed to operate against st . mal ##o ; however , this action proved imp ##rac ##tical . worse ##ning weather forced the two armies to separate : the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of st . cast , while the army proceeded overland . the tar ##dine ##ss of b ##li ##gh in moving his forces allowed a french force of 10 , 000 from brest to catch up with him and open fire on the re ##em ##bar ##kat ##ion troops . a rear - guard of 1 , 400 under general du ##ry held off the french while the rest of the army embarked . they could not be saved ; 750 , including du ##ry , were killed and the rest captured .
this effectively brought french power in india to an end [SEP] in india , the british retained the northern circa ##rs , but returned all the french trading ports . the treaty , however , required that the fortifications of these settlements be destroyed and never rebuilt , while only minimal garrison ##s could be maintained there , thus rendering them worthless as military bases . combined with the loss of france ' s ally in bengal and the defect ##ion of hyderabad to the british as a result of the war , this effectively brought french power in india to an end , making way for british he ##ge ##mony and eventual control of the subcontinent .
austria ' s prestige was restored in great part [SEP] austria was not able to re ##take silesia or make any significant territorial gain . however , it did prevent prussia from invading parts of saxony . more significantly , its military performance proved far better than during the war of the austrian succession and seemed to vin ##dicate maria theresa ' s administrative and military reforms . hence , austria ' s prestige was restored in great part and the empire secured its position as a major player in the european system . also , by promising to vote for joseph ii in the imperial elections , frederick ii accepted the habsburg pre ##emi ##nen ##ce in the holy roman empire . the survival of prussia as a first - rate power and the enhanced prestige of its king and its army , however , was potentially damaging in the long run to austria ' s influence in germany .

destruction of hiroshima by the bomb [SEP] after the war , fey ##n ##man declined an offer from the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , despite the presence there of such distinguished faculty members as albert einstein , kurt god ##el and john von neumann . fey ##n ##man followed hans beth ##e , instead , to cornell university , where fey ##n ##man taught theoretical physics from 1945 to 1950 . during a temporary depression following the destruction of hiroshima by the bomb produced by the manhattan project , he focused on complex physics problems , not for utility , but for self - satisfaction . one of these was analyzing the physics of a t ##wi ##rling , nut ##ating dish as it is moving through the air . his work during this period , which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds , proved important to his nobel prize – winning work , yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems , he was surprised by the offers of professorship ##s from other renowned universities .
no teaching duties [SEP] despite yet another offer from the institute for advanced study , fey ##n ##man rejected the institute on the grounds that there were no teaching duties : fey ##n ##man felt that students were a source of inspiration and teaching was a diversion during un ##cre ##ative spells . because of this , the institute for advanced study and princeton university jointly offered him a package whereby he could teach at the university and also be at the institute . [ citation needed ] fey ##n ##man instead accepted an offer from the california institute of technology ( cal ##tech ) — and as he says in his book surely you ' re joking mr . fey ##n ##man ! — because a desire to live in a mild climate had firmly fixed itself in his mind while he was installing tire chains on his car in the middle of a snow ##storm in ithaca .
connections to drugs and rock and roll [SEP] fey ##n ##man was elected a foreign member of the royal society ( form ##em ##rs ) in 1965 . at this time in the early 1960s , fey ##n ##man exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time , including a request , while at cal ##tech , to " spruce up " the teaching of undergraduate ##s . after three years devoted to the task , he produced a series of lectures that eventually became the fey ##n ##man lectures on physics . he wanted a picture of a drum ##head sp ##rin ##kled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book . concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image , the publishers changed the cover to plain red , though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword . the fey ##n ##man lectures on physics occupied two physicist ##s , robert b . leighton and matthew sands , as part - time co - authors for several years . even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks , they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics . many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books , including the character of physical law , q ##ed : the strange theory of light and matter , statistical mechanics , lectures on gr ##avi ##tation , and the fey ##n ##man lectures on computation .
he did not want to do anything that could damage his brain [SEP] according to genius , the james g ##lei ##ck - authored biography , fey ##n ##man tried l ##sd during his professorship at cal ##tech . somewhat embarrassed by his actions , he largely sides ##te ##pped the issue when di ##cta ##ting his an ##ec ##dote ##s ; he mentions it in passing in the " o american ##o , out ##ra ve ##z " section , while the " altered states " chapter in surely you ' re joking , mr . fey ##n ##man ! describes only marijuana and ke ##tam ##ine experiences at john lilly ' s famed sensory deprivation tanks , as a way of studying consciousness . fey ##n ##man gave up alcohol when he began to show vague , early signs of alcoholism , as he did not want to do anything that could damage his brain — the same reason given in " o american ##o , out ##ra ve ##z " for his reluctance to experiment with l ##sd .

watered - down format of the ceremony resulting from conflicts in the 2007 – 08 writers strike [SEP] the science fiction hall of fame inducted spielberg in 2005 , the first year it considered non - literary contributors . in november 2007 , he was chosen for a lifetime achievement award to be presented at the sixth annual visual effects society awards in february 2009 . he was set to be honored with the cecil b . demi ##lle award at the january 2008 golden globe ##s ; however , the new , watered - down format of the ceremony resulting from conflicts in the 2007 – 08 writers strike , the h ##fp ##a postponed his honor to the 2009 ceremony . in 2008 , spielberg was awarded the legion d ' honneur .
cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue [SEP] historically , ac motors were used for single or double speed elevator machines on the grounds of cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue , but for higher speed , larger capacity elevators , the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue . therefore , dc machines powered by an ac / dc motor generator were the preferred solution . the mg set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator , which has the added advantage of electrically iso ##lating the elevators from the rest of a building ' s electrical system , thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building ' s electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping ( causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example ) , as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arc ##ing of the relay contact ##ors in the control system .
the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards ; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight [SEP] the low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise , low traffic installations . they are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards ; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight . the high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building ’ s electrical system . there are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground .
if the operator let go of the handle , it would return to its upright position , causing the elevator cab to stop [SEP] the elevator motor was located at the top of the shaft or beside the bottom of the shaft . pushing the handle forward would cause the cab to rise ; backwards would make it sink . the harder the pressure , the faster the elevator would move . the handle also served as a dead man switch : if the operator let go of the handle , it would return to its upright position , causing the elevator cab to stop . in time , safety inter ##lock ##s would ensure that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move .
this will make the computer think multiple people are waiting and will all ##oca ##te empty cars to serve this one person [SEP] however , performance enhancement ##s cannot be generalized as the benefits and limitations of the system are dependent on many factors . one problem is that the system is subject to gaming . sometimes , one person enters the destination for a large group of people going to the same floor . the dispatch ##ing algorithm is usually unable to completely cater for the variation , and late ##com ##ers may find the elevator they are assigned to is already full . also , occasionally , one person may press the floor multiple times . this is common with up / down buttons when people believe this to be an effective way to hurry elevators . however , this will make the computer think multiple people are waiting and will all ##oca ##te empty cars to serve this one person .
to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity [SEP] during up - peak mode ( also called moderate incoming traffic ) , elevator cars in a group are recalled to the lobby to provide ex ##ped ##iti ##ous service to passengers arriving at the building , most typically in the morning as people arrive for work or at the conclusion of a lunch - time period . elevators are dispatched one - by - one when they reach a pre - determined passenger load , or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time . the next elevator to be dispatched usually has its hall lantern or a " this car leaving next " sign illuminated to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity . some elevator banks are programmed so that at least one car will always return to the lobby floor and park whenever it becomes free .
the elevator will wait an amount of time , then proceed to go into nu ##d ##ging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor [SEP] phase one mode is activated by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building . once an alarm has been activated , the elevator will automatically go into phase one . the elevator will wait an amount of time , then proceed to go into nu ##d ##ging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor . once the elevator has left the floor , depending on where the alarm was set off , the elevator will go to the fire - recall floor . however , if the alarm was activated on the fire - recall floor , the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to . when the elevator is recalled , it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open . the elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction . located on the fire - recall floor is a fire - service key switch . the fire - service key switch has the ability to turn fire service off , turn fire service on or to bypass fire service . the only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset .
the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to [SEP] phase one mode is activated by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building . once an alarm has been activated , the elevator will automatically go into phase one . the elevator will wait an amount of time , then proceed to go into nu ##d ##ging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor . once the elevator has left the floor , depending on where the alarm was set off , the elevator will go to the fire - recall floor . however , if the alarm was activated on the fire - recall floor , the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to . when the elevator is recalled , it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open . the elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction . located on the fire - recall floor is a fire - service key switch . the fire - service key switch has the ability to turn fire service off , turn fire service on or to bypass fire service . the only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset .
earth ' s orbit takes it past an outer planet [SEP] some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope , galileo ' s drawings on 28 december 1612 and 27 january 161 ##3 , contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of neptune . on both occasions , galileo seems to have mistaken neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close — in conjunction — to jupiter in the night sky ; hence , he is not credited with neptune ' s discovery . at his first observation in december 1612 , neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retro ##grade that day . this apparent backward motion is created when earth ' s orbit takes it past an outer planet . because neptune was only beginning its yearly retro ##grade cycle , the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with galileo ' s small telescope . in july 2009 , university of melbourne physicist david jamie ##son announced new evidence suggesting that galileo was at least aware that the ' star ' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars .
conversion was not well developed [SEP] railways must operate at variable speeds . until the mid 1980s this was only practical with the brush - type dc motor , although such dc can be supplied from an ac cat ##enary via on - board electric power conversion . since such conversion was not well developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century , most early electrified railways used dc and many still do , particularly rapid transit ( subway ##s ) and trams . speed was controlled by connecting the traction motors in various series - parallel combinations , by varying the traction motors ' fields , and by insert ##ing and removing starting resistance ##s to limit motor current .
low voltage ratings [SEP] motors have very little room for electrical insulation so they generally have low voltage ratings . because transformers ( prior to the development of power electronics ) cannot step down dc voltage ##s , trains were supplied with a relatively low dc voltage that the motors can use directly . the most common dc voltage ##s are listed in the previous section . third ( and fourth ) rail systems almost always use voltage ##s below 1 kv for safety reasons while overhead wires usually use higher voltage ##s for efficiency . ( " low " voltage is relative ; even 600 v can be instantly lethal when touched . )
having to ' run around ' the rest of the train [SEP] a few lines of the paris metro in france operate on a four - rail power scheme because they run on rubber tyres which run on a pair of narrow roadway ##s made of steel and , in some places , concrete . since the tyres do not conduct the return current , the two guide rails provided outside the running ' roadway ##s ' double up as conductor rails , so at least electrically it is a four - rail scheme . one of the guide rails is bonded to the return conventional running rails situated inside the roadway so a single polar ##ity supply is required . the trains are designed to operate from either polar ##ity of supply , because some lines use rev ##ers ##ing loops at one end , causing the train to be reversed during every complete journey . the loop was originally provided to save the original steam locomotives having to ' run around ' the rest of the train saving much time . today , the driver does not have to change ends at term ##ini provided with such a loop , but the time saving is not so significant as it takes almost as long to drive round the loop as it does to change ends . many of the original loops have been lost as lines were extended .
due to inc ##omp ##ati ##bility of electrification standards [SEP] additionally , there are issues of connections between different electrical services , particularly connecting intercity lines with sections electrified for commuter traffic , but also between commuter lines built to different standards . this can cause electrification of certain connections to be very expensive simply because of the implications on the sections it is connecting . many lines have come to be over ##laid with multiple electrification standards for different trains to avoid having to replace the existing rolling stock on those lines . obviously , this requires that the economics of a particular connection must be more compelling and this has prevented complete electrification of many lines . in a few cases , there are diesel trains running along completely electrified routes and this can be due to inc ##omp ##ati ##bility of electrification standards along the route .
cooling blow ##ers [SEP] central station electricity can often be generated with higher efficiency than a mobile engine / generator . while the efficiency of power plant generation and diesel locomotive generation are roughly the same in the nominal regime , diesel motors decrease in efficiency in non - nominal regimes at low power while if an electric power plant needs to generate less power it will shut down its least efficient generators , thereby increasing efficiency . the electric train can save energy ( as compared to diesel ) by reg ##ener ##ative braking and by not needing to consume energy by id ##ling as diesel locomotives do when stopped or coast ##ing . however , electric rolling stock may run cooling blow ##ers when stopped or coast ##ing , thus consuming energy .
energy - intensity dropping [SEP] besides increased efficiency of power plants , there was an increase in efficiency ( between 1950 and 1973 ) of the railway utilization of this electricity with energy - intensity dropping from 218 to 124 kw ##h / 10 , 000 gross ton ##ne - km ( of both passenger and freight trains ) or a 43 % drop . since energy - intensity is the inverse of energy - efficiency it drops as efficiency goes up . but most of this 43 % decrease in energy - intensity also benefited diesel traction . the conversion of wheel bearings from plain to roller , increase of train weight , converting single track lines to double track ( or partially double track ) , and the elimination of obsolete 2 - axle freight cars increased the energy - efficiency of all types of traction : electric , diesel , and steam . however , there remained a 12 – 15 % reduction of energy - intensity that only benefited electric traction ( and not diesel ) . this was due to improvements in locomotives , more widespread use of reg ##ener ##ative braking ( which in 1989 recycled 2 . 65 % of the electric energy used for traction , ) remote control of sub ##station ##s , better handling of the locomotive by the locomotive crew , and improvements in automation . thus the overall efficiency of electric traction as compared to diesel more than doubled between 1950 and the mid - 1970s in the soviet union . but after 1974 ( thru 1980 ) there was no improvement in energy - intensity ( w ##h / ton ##ne - km ) in part due to increasing speeds of passenger and freight trains .
the geographical isolation and unique political history of this territory [SEP] after the mexican war of independence from spain also , california , nevada , arizona , utah , western colorado and southwestern wyoming became part of the mexican territory of alta california and most of new mexico , western texas , southern colorado , southwestern kansas , and oklahoma pan ##hand ##le were part of the territory of santa fe de nuevo mexico . the geographical isolation and unique political history of this territory led to new mexican spanish differing notably from both spanish spoken in other parts of the united states of america and spanish spoken in the present - day united mexican states .
immigration to the united states of spanish - speaking cuban ##s began because of cuba ' s political instability [SEP] immigration to the united states of spanish - speaking cuban ##s began because of cuba ' s political instability upon achieving independence . the deposition of fu ##lge ##nc ##io bat ##ista ' s dictatorship and the ascension of fide ##l castro ' s government in 1959 increased cuban immigration to the united states , hence there are some one million cuban ##s in the united states , most settled in southern and central florida , while other cuban ##s live in the northeastern united states ; most are fluent in spanish . in the city of miami today spanish is the first language mostly due to cuban immigration .
political instability during the end of the 1970s and the 1980s [SEP] likewise the migration of spanish - speaking nicaragua ##ns also began as a result of political instability during the end of the 1970s and the 1980s . the uprising of the sand ##ini ##sta revolution which toppled the so ##mo ##za dictatorship in 1979 caused many nicaragua ##ns to migrate particularly from those opposing the sand ##ini ##sta ##s . throughout the 1980s with the united states supported contra war ( or contra - revolutionary war ) which continued up until 1988 , and the economic collapse of the country many more nicaragua ##ns migrated to the united states amongst other countries . the states of the united states where most nicaragua ##ns migrated to include florida , california and texas .
the exodus of salvador ##ans was a result of both economic and political problems . [SEP] the exodus of salvador ##ans was a result of both economic and political problems . the largest immigration wave occurred as a result of the salvador ##an civil war in the 1980s , in which 20 – 30 % of el salvador ' s population emigrated . about 50 % , or up to 500 , 000 of those who escaped headed to the united states , which was already home to over 10 , 000 salvador ##ans , making salvador ##ans americans the fourth - largest hispanic and latino american group , after the mexican - american majority , states ##ide puerto rican ##s , and cuban ##s .
civil wars engulfed several central american countries in the 1980s [SEP] as civil wars engulfed several central american countries in the 1980s , hundreds of thousands of salvador ##ans fled their country and came to the united states . between 1980 and 1990 , the salvador ##an immigrant population in the united states increased nearly five ##fold from 94 , 000 to 46 ##5 , 000 . the number of salvador ##an immigrants in the united states continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of family reunification and new arrivals fleeing a series of natural disasters that hit el salvador , including earthquakes and hurricanes . by 2008 , there were about 1 . 1 million salvador ##an immigrants in the united states .
many venezuelan ##s settled in the united states with hopes of receiving a better education , only to remain in there following graduation . [SEP] until the 20th century , there was no clear record of the number of venezuelan ##s who emigrated to the united states . between the 18th and early 19th centuries , there were many european immigrants who went to venezuela , only to later migrate to the united states along with their children and grandchildren who born and / or grew up in venezuela speaking spanish . from 1910 to 1930 , it is estimated that over 4 , 000 south americans each year emigrated to the united states ; however , there are few specific figures indicating these statistics . many venezuelan ##s settled in the united states with hopes of receiving a better education , only to remain in there following graduation . they are frequently joined by relatives . however , since the early 1980s , the reasons for venezuelan emigration have changed to include hopes of earning a higher salary and due to the economic fluctuations in venezuela which also promoted an important migration of venezuelan professionals to the us .
because of its relative isolation from other spanish - speaking areas over most of its 400 - year existence [SEP] because of its relative isolation from other spanish - speaking areas over most of its 400 - year existence , new mexico spanish , and in particular the spanish of northern new mexico and colorado has retained many elements of 16th - and 17th - century spanish and has developed its own vocabulary . in addition , it contains many words from nah ##ua ##tl , the language spoken by the ancient aztec ##s of mexico . new mexican spanish also contains loan words from the pueblo languages of the upper rio grande valley , mexican - spanish words ( mexican ##ism ##os ) , and borrowing ##s from english . grammatical changes include the loss of the second person verb form , changes in verb endings , particularly in the pre ##ter ##ite , and partial merging of the second and third con ##ju ##gation ##s .
inability to damage industries [SEP] adolf hitler failed to pay as much attention to bombing the enemy as he did to protection from enemy bombing , although he had promoted the development of a bomber force in the 1930s and understood that it was possible to use bombers for major strategic purposes . he told the ok ##l in 1939 that ruthless employment of the luftwaffe against the heart of the british will to resist could and would follow when the moment was right ; however , he quickly developed a lively sc ##ept ##ici ##sm toward strategic bombing , confirmed by the results of the blitz . he frequently complained of the luftwaffe ' s inability to damage industries sufficiently , saying , " the munitions industry cannot be interfered with effectively by air raids . . . usually the prescribed targets are not hit " .
prescribed targets are not hit [SEP] adolf hitler failed to pay as much attention to bombing the enemy as he did to protection from enemy bombing , although he had promoted the development of a bomber force in the 1930s and understood that it was possible to use bombers for major strategic purposes . he told the ok ##l in 1939 that ruthless employment of the luftwaffe against the heart of the british will to resist could and would follow when the moment was right ; however , he quickly developed a lively sc ##ept ##ici ##sm toward strategic bombing , confirmed by the results of the blitz . he frequently complained of the luftwaffe ' s inability to damage industries sufficiently , saying , " the munitions industry cannot be interfered with effectively by air raids . . . usually the prescribed targets are not hit " .
to produce a stale ##mate [SEP] ultimately , hitler was trapped within his own vision of bombing as a terror weapon , formed in the 1930s when he threatened smaller nations into accepting german rule rather than submit to air bombardment . this fact had important implications . it showed the extent to which hitler personally mist ##ook allied strategy for one of morale breaking instead of one of economic warfare , with the collapse of morale as an additional bonus . hitler was much more attracted to the political aspects of bombing . as the mere threat of it had produced diplomatic results in the 1930s , he expected that the threat of german retaliation would persuade the allies to adopt a policy of mode ##ration and not to begin a policy of unrest ##ricted bombing . his hope was — for reasons of political prestige within germany itself — that the german population would be protected from the allied bombings . when this proved impossible , he began to fear that popular feeling would turn against his regime , and he red ##ou ##bled efforts to mount a similar " terror offensive " against britain in order to produce a stale ##mate in which both sides would hesitate to use bombing at all .
to gain air superiority [SEP] although not specifically prepared to conduct independent strategic air operations against an opponent , the luftwaffe was expected to do so over britain . from july until september 1940 the luftwaffe attacked raf fighter command to gain air superiority as a prelude to invasion . this involved the bombing of english channel convoys , ports , and raf airfields and supporting industries . destroying raf fighter command would allow the germans to gain control of the skies over the invasion area . it was supposed that bomber command , raf coastal command and the royal navy could not operate under conditions of german air superiority .
poor intelligence [SEP] the luftwaffe ' s poor intelligence meant that their aircraft were not always able to locate their targets , and thus attacks on factories and airfields failed to achieve the desired results . british fighter aircraft production continued at a rate surpassing germany ' s by 2 to 1 . the british produced 10 , 000 aircraft in 1940 , in comparison to germany ' s 8 , 000 . the replacement of pilots and air ##cre ##w was more difficult . both the raf and luftwaffe struggled to replace manpower losses , though the germans had larger reserves of trained air ##cre ##w . the circumstances affected the germans more than the british . operating over home territory , british flyers could fly again if they survived being shot down . german crews , even if they survived , faced capture . moreover , bombers had four to five crew ##men on board , representing a greater loss of manpower . on 7 september , the germans shifted away from the destruction of the raf ' s supporting structures . german intelligence suggested fighter command was weakening , and an attack on london would force it into a final battle of ann ##ih ##ilation while compelling the british government to surrender .
damage civilian morale [SEP] the government planned to voluntarily evacuate four million people — mostly women and children — from urban areas , including 1 . 4 million from london . it expected about 90 % of eva ##cu ##ees to stay in private homes , and conducted an extensive survey to determine available space . detailed preparations for transporting them were developed . a trial blackout was held on 10 august 1939 , and when germany invaded poland on 1 september a blackout began at sunset . lights would not be allowed after dark for almost six years , and the blackout became by far the most unpopular aspect of the war for civilians , more than ratio ##ning . : 51 , 106 the relocation of the government and the civil service was also planned , but would only have occurred if necessary so as not to damage civilian morale . : 33
unsafe [SEP] much civil - defence preparation in the form of shelters was left in the hands of local authorities , and many areas such as birmingham , coventry , belfast and the east end of london did not have enough shelters . the phone ##y war , however , and the unexpected delay of civilian bombing permitted the shelter programme to finish in june 1940 . : 35 the programme favoured backyard anderson shelters and small brick surface shelters ; many of the latter were soon abandoned in 1940 as unsafe . in addition , authorities expected that the raids would be brief and during the day . few predicted that attacks by night would force london ##ers to sleep in shelters .
attacks by night [SEP] much civil - defence preparation in the form of shelters was left in the hands of local authorities , and many areas such as birmingham , coventry , belfast and the east end of london did not have enough shelters . the phone ##y war , however , and the unexpected delay of civilian bombing permitted the shelter programme to finish in june 1940 . : 35 the programme favoured backyard anderson shelters and small brick surface shelters ; many of the latter were soon abandoned in 1940 as unsafe . in addition , authorities expected that the raids would be brief and during the day . few predicted that attacks by night would force london ##ers to sleep in shelters .
interfere with commuter and troop travel [SEP] the most important existing communal shelters were the london underground stations . although many civilians had used them as such during the first world war , the government in 1939 refused to allow the stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel , and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave . underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids ; but by the second week of heavy bombing the government re ##lent ##ed and ordered the stations to be opened . each day orderly lines of people queue ##d until 4 pm , when they were allowed to enter the stations . in mid - september 1940 about 150 , 000 a night slept in the underground , although by the winter and spring months the numbers had declined to 100 , 000 or less . noises of battle were muffled and sleep was easier in the deepest stations , but many were killed from direct hits on several stations .

lack of need [SEP] ing ##ers ##oll added that , according to anna freud and edward glover , london civilians surprisingly did not suffer from widespread shell shock , unlike the soldiers in the dunkirk evacuation . : 114 , 117 – 118 the psycho ##anal ##yst ##s were correct , and the special network of psychiatric clinics opened to receive mental casualties of the attacks closed due to lack of need . although the stress of the war resulted in many anxiety attacks , eating disorders , fatigue , weeping , mis ##carriage ##s , and other physical and mental ai ##lm ##ents , society did not collapse . the number of suicide ##s and drunken ##ness declined , and london recorded only about two cases of " bomb ne ##uro ##ses " per week in the first three months of bombing . many civilians found that the best way to retain mental stability was to be with family , and after the first few weeks of bombing avoidance of the evacuation programs grew . : 80 – 81 glover speculated that the knowledge that the entire country was being attacked , that there was no way to escape the bombs , forced people to accept and deal with the situation . : 118
lack of reaction to the new crisis [SEP] in the inter - war years and after 1940 , hugh dow ##ding , air officer commanding fighter command has received credit for the defence of british air space and the failure of the luftwaffe to achieve air superiority . however , dow ##ding had spent so much effort preparing day fighter defences , there was little to prevent the germans carrying out an alternative strategy by bombing at night . when the luftwaffe struck at british cities for the first time on 7 september 1940 , a number of civic and political leaders were worried by dow ##ding ' s apparent lack of reaction to the new crisis .
lacked the technology and equipment [SEP] british air doctrine , since the time of chief of the air staff hugh trench ##ard in the early 1920s , had stressed offence was the best means of defence . british defensive strategy rev ##olved around offensive action , what became known as the cult of the offensive . to prevent german formations from hitting targets in britain , raf ' s bomber command would destroy luftwaffe aircraft on their own bases , aircraft in their factories and fuel reserves by attacking oil plants . this philosophy was imp ##rac ##tical as bomber command lacked the technology and equipment and needed several years to develop it . this strategy re ##tar ##ded the development of fighter defences in the 1930s . dow ##ding agreed air defence would require some offensive action , and fighters could not defend britain alone . until september 1940 , the raf lacked specialist night - fighting aircraft and relied on anti - aircraft units which were poorly equipped and lacking in numbers .
weather was poor [SEP] on 9 september the ok ##l appeared to be backing two strategies . its round - the - clock bombing of london was an immediate attempt to force the british government to cap ##it ##ulate , but it was also striking at britain ' s vital sea communications to achieve a victory through siege . although the weather was poor , heavy raids took place that afternoon on the london suburbs and the airfield at far ##nb ##orough . the day ' s fighting cost ke ##ssel ##ring and lu ##ft ##fl ##otte 2 ( air fleet 2 ) 24 aircraft , including 13 bf 109 ##s . fighter command lost 17 fighters and six pilots . over the next few days weather was poor and the next main effort would not be made until 15 september 1940 .
to try to disrupt trade and sea communications [SEP] not all of the luftwaffe ' s effort was made against inland cities . port cities were also attacked to try to disrupt trade and sea communications . in january swansea was bombed four times , very heavily . on 17 january around 100 bombers dropped a high concentration of inc ##end ##ia ##ries , some 32 , 000 in all . the main damage was inflicted on the commercial and domestic areas . four days later 230 tons was dropped including 60 , 000 inc ##end ##ia ##ries . in portsmouth south ##sea and go ##sport waves of 150 bombers destroyed vast swat ##hs of the city with 40 , 000 inc ##end ##ia ##ries . warehouses , rail lines and houses were destroyed and damaged , but the docks were largely untouched .
airfields became water - logged [SEP] a further line in the directive stressed the need to in ##flict the heaviest losses possible , but also to int ##ens ##ify the air war in order to create the impression an amphibious assault on britain was planned for 1941 . however , meteorological conditions over britain were not favourable for flying and prevented an es ##cala ##tion in air operations . airfields became water - logged and the 18 kam ##pf ##gr ##uppe ##n ( bomber groups ) of the luftwaffe ' s kam ##pf ##ges ##ch ##wad ##ern ( bomber wings ) were relocated to germany for rest and re - equipment .
ports were easier to find [SEP] from the german point of view , march 1941 saw an improvement . the luftwaffe flew 4 , 000 sort ##ies that month , including 12 major and three heavy attacks . the electronic war intensified but the luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moon ##lit nights . ports were easier to find and made better targets . to confuse the british , radio silence was observed until the bombs fell . x - and y - ge ##rat beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute . rapid frequency changes were introduced for x - ge ##rat , whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when british selective jam ##ming was de ##grad ##ing the effectiveness of y - ge ##rat .

shortage of bombers [SEP] the attacks were focused against western ports in march . these attacks produced some breaks in morale , with civil leaders fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its height . but the luftwaffe ' s effort eased in the last 10 attacks as seven kam ##pf ##gr ##uppe ##n moved to austria in preparation for the balkans campaign in yugoslavia and greece . the shortage of bombers caused the ok ##l to imp ##rov ##ise . some 50 junk ##ers ju 87 stu ##ka dive - bombers and ja ##bos ( fighter - bombers ) were used , officially classed as lei ##cht ##e kam ##pf ##fl ##ug ##ze ##uge ( " light bombers " ) and sometimes called lei ##cht ##e ke ##ssel ##ring ##e ( " light ke ##ssel ##ring ##s " ) . the defences failed to prevent widespread damage but on some occasions did prevent german bombers concentrating on their targets . on occasion , only one - third of german bombs hit their targets .
woke up to discover the entire crew asleep . [SEP] the diversion of heavier bombers to the balkans meant that the crews and units left behind were asked to fly two or three sort ##ies per night . bombers were noisy , cold , and vibrated badly . added to the tension of the mission which exhausted and drained crews , tired ##ness caught up with and killed many . in one incident on 28 / 29 april , peter st ##ahl of kg 30 was flying on his 50th mission . he fell asleep at the controls of his ju 88 and woke up to discover the entire crew asleep . he rouse ##d them , ensured they took oxygen and dex ##tro - en ##er ##gen tablets , then completed the mission .
because of its vulnerable position on the south coast [SEP] on 13 march , the upper clyde port of clyde ##bank near glasgow was bombed . all but seven of its 12 , 000 houses were damaged . many more ports were attacked . plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the month while belfast , hull , and cardiff were hit . cardiff was bombed on three nights , portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids . the rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40 , 000 people per week de ##house ##d in september 1940 . in march 1941 , two raids on plymouth and london de ##house ##d 148 , 000 people . still , while heavily damaged , british ports continued to support war industry and supplies from north america continued to pass through them while the royal navy continued to operate in plymouth , southampton , and portsmouth . plymouth in particular , because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to german air bases , was subjected to the heaviest attacks . on 10 / 11 march , 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46 , 000 inc ##end ##ia ##ries . many houses and commercial centres were heavily damaged , the electrical supply was knocked out , and five oil tanks and two magazines exploded . nine days later , two waves of 125 and 170 bombers dropped heavy bombs , including 160 tons of high explosive and 32 , 000 inc ##end ##ia ##ries . much of the city centre was destroyed . damage was inflicted on the port installations , but many bombs fell on the city itself . on 17 april 34 ##6 tons of explosives and 46 , 000 inc ##end ##ia ##ries were dropped from 250 bombers led by kg 26 . the damage was considerable , and the germans also used aerial mines . over 2 , 000 aaa shells were fired , destroying two ju 88 ##s . by the end of the air campaign over britain , only eight percent of the german effort against british ports was made using mines .
when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices , utilities and transport . [SEP] the relieved british began to assess the impact of the blitz in august 1941 , and the raf air staff used the german experience to improve bomber command ' s offensive ##s . they concluded bombers should strike a single target each night and use more inc ##end ##ia ##ries because they had a greater impact on production than high explosives . they also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices , utilities and transport . they believed the luftwaffe had failed in precision attack , and concluded the german example of area attack using inc ##end ##ia ##ries was the way forward for operations over germany .
few consultation ##s result in jeopardy opinions [SEP] there have been six instances as of 2009 in which the exemption process was initiated . of these six , one was granted , one was partially granted , one was denied and three were withdrawn . donald ba ##ur , in the endangered species act : law , policy , and perspectives , concluded , " . . . the exemption provision is basically a non ##fa ##ctor in the administration of the esa . a major reason , of course , is that so few consultation ##s result in jeopardy opinions , and those that do almost always result in the identification of reasonable and pr ##ude ##nt alternatives to avoid jeopardy . "
the fish and wildlife service ( f ##ws ) loses much ability to further protect a species if the mit ##iga ##tion measures by the landowner prove insufficient . [SEP] the " no surprises " rule is meant to protect the landowner if " un ##for ##ese ##en circumstances " occur which make the landowner ' s efforts to prevent or mit ##igate harm to the species fall short . the " no surprises " policy may be the most controversial of the recent reforms of the law , because once an incident ##al take permit is granted , the fish and wildlife service ( f ##ws ) loses much ability to further protect a species if the mit ##iga ##tion measures by the landowner prove insufficient . the landowner or permit ##tee would not be required to set aside additional land or pay more in conservation money . the federal government would have to pay for additional protection measures .
the us fish and wildlife service revealed that the agency does not have sufficient staff to perform undercover investigations [SEP] according to research published in 1999 by alan green and the center for public integrity ( cpi ) , loop ##holes in the esa are commonly exploited in the exotic pet trade . although the legislation prohibits interstate and foreign transactions for list species , no provisions are made for in - state commerce , allowing these animals to be sold to roadside zoo ##s and private collectors . additionally , the esa allows listed species to be shipped across state lines as long as they are not sold . according to green and the cpi , this allows dealers to " donate " listed species through supposed " breeding loans " to anyone , and in return they can legally receive a reciprocal monetary " donation " from the receiving party . furthermore , an interview with an endangered species specialist at the us fish and wildlife service revealed that the agency does not have sufficient staff to perform undercover investigations , which would catch these false " donations " and other mis ##lab ##ele ##d transactions .
over 800 cotton - top tam ##ari ##ns were imported into the united states [SEP] green and the cpi further noted another exploit of the esa in their discussion of the critically endangered cotton - top tam ##ari ##n ( sa ##gui ##nus o ##ed ##ip ##us ) . not only had they found documentation that 151 of these primate ##s had inadvertently made their way from the harvard - affiliated new england regional primate research center into the exotic pet trade through the aforementioned loop ##hole , but in october 1976 , over 800 cotton - top tam ##ari ##ns were imported into the united states in order to beat the official listing of the species under the esa .
rapid deco ##mp ##ress ##ion [SEP] rapid deco ##mp ##ress ##ion can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself . even if the victim does not hold his or her breath , vent ##ing through the wind ##pipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal ru ##pt ##ure of the delicate al ##ve ##oli of the lungs . ear ##drum ##s and sin ##uses may be ru ##pt ##ured by rapid deco ##mp ##ress ##ion , soft tissues may bruise and see ##p blood , and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to h ##yp ##ox ##ia . injuries caused by rapid deco ##mp ##ress ##ion are called bar ##ot ##ra ##uma . a pressure drop of 13 k ##pa ( 100 tor ##r ) , which produces no symptoms if it is gradual , may be fatal if it occurs suddenly .
atmospheric density [SEP] but although it meets the definition of outer space , the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the karma ##n line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites . most artificial satellites operate in this region called low earth orbit and must fire their engines every few days to maintain orbit . [ citation needed ] the drag here is low enough that it could theoretically be overcome by radiation pressure on solar sails , a proposed propulsion system for inter ##plane ##tary travel . [ citation needed ] planets are too massive for their tr ##aj ##ect ##ories to be significantly affected by these forces , although their atmosphere ##s are eroded by the solar winds .
" while the inter ##stellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether , [ it ] is character ##is [SEP] while outer space provides the most rare ##fied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum , the heavens were originally thought to be seam ##lessly filled by a rigid ind ##est ##ru ##ct ##ible material called ae ##ther . borrowing somewhat from the p ##ne ##uma of st ##oic physics , ae ##ther came to be regarded as the rare ##fied air from which it took its name , ( see ae ##ther ( mythology ) ) . early theories of light po ##sit ##ed a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light prop ##aga ##ted . additionally , the concept informed isaac newton ' s explanations of both ref ##raction and of radiant heat . 19th century experiments into this lu ##mini ##fer ##ous ae ##ther attempted to detect a minute drag on the earth ' s orbit . while the earth does , in fact , move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of inter ##stellar space , the drag is so minus ##cule that it could not be detected . in 1912 , astronomer henry pickering commented : " while the inter ##stellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether , [ it ] is characteristic of a gas , and free gas ##eous molecules are certainly there " .
its high density and low va ##pour pressure [SEP] hydro ##static gauge ##s ( such as the mercury column man ##ometer ) consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures . the column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube . the simplest design is a closed - end u - shaped tube , one side of which is connected to the region of interest . any fluid can be used , but mercury is preferred for its high density and low va ##pour pressure . simple hydro ##static gauge ##s can measure pressures ranging from 1 tor ##r ( 100 pa ) to above atmospheric . an important variation is the mcleod gauge which isolate ##s a known volume of vacuum and com ##press ##es it to multi ##ply the height variation of the liquid column . the mcleod gauge can measure vacuum ##s as high as 10 ##− ##6 tor ##r ( 0 . 1 mp ##a ) , which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology . other vacuum gauge ##s can measure lower pressures , but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure - controlled properties . these indirect measurements must be cal ##ib ##rated via a direct measurement , most commonly a mcleod gauge .
can measure vacuum ##s as high as 10 ##− ##6 tor ##r [SEP] hydro ##static gauge ##s ( such as the mercury column man ##ometer ) consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures . the column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube . the simplest design is a closed - end u - shaped tube , one side of which is connected to the region of interest . any fluid can be used , but mercury is preferred for its high density and low va ##pour pressure . simple hydro ##static gauge ##s can measure pressures ranging from 1 tor ##r ( 100 pa ) to above atmospheric . an important variation is the mcleod gauge which isolate ##s a known volume of vacuum and com ##press ##es it to multi ##ply the height variation of the liquid column . the mcleod gauge can measure vacuum ##s as high as 10 ##− ##6 tor ##r ( 0 . 1 mp ##a ) , which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology . other vacuum gauge ##s can measure lower pressures , but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure - controlled properties . these indirect measurements must be cal ##ib ##rated via a direct measurement , most commonly a mcleod gauge .
composition of gases at high vacuum ##s will usually be unpredictable [SEP] ion gauge ##s are used in ultra ##hi ##gh vacuum . they come in two types : hot cat ##ho ##de and cold cat ##ho ##de . in the hot cat ##ho ##de version an electrically heated fi ##lam ##ent produces an electron beam . the electrons travel through the gauge and ion ##ize gas molecules around them . the resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode . the current depends on the number of ions , which depends on the pressure in the gauge . hot cat ##ho ##de gauge ##s are accurate from 10 ##− ##3 tor ##r to 10 ##−1 ##0 tor ##r . the principle behind cold cat ##ho ##de version is the same , except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge . cold cat ##ho ##de gauge ##s are accurate from 10 ##− ##2 tor ##r to 10 ##− ##9 tor ##r . ion ##ization gauge cal ##ib ##ration is very sensitive to construction geometry , chemical composition of gases being measured , corrosion and surface deposits . their cal ##ib ##ration can be invalid ##ated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum . the composition of gases at high vacuum ##s will usually be unpredictable , so a mass spec ##trom ##eter must be used in conjunction with the ion ##ization gauge for accurate measurement .
impossible to eliminate all the black ##body photon ##s [SEP] in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory , the vacuum is defined as the state ( that is , the solution to the equations of the theory ) with the lowest possible energy ( the ground state of the hilbert space ) . in quantum electro ##dy ##nami ##cs this vacuum is referred to as ' q ##ed vacuum ' to distinguish it from the vacuum of quantum ch ##rom ##od ##yna ##mics , denoted as qc ##d vacuum . q ##ed vacuum is a state with no matter particles ( hence the name ) , and also no photon ##s . as described above , this state is impossible to achieve experimental ##ly . ( even if every matter particle could somehow be removed from a volume , it would be impossible to eliminate all the black ##body photon ##s . ) nonetheless , it provides a good model for real ##iza ##ble vacuum , and agrees with a number of experimental observations as described next .
protection against loss of all ( electrically powered ) instruments , [SEP] manifold vacuum can be used to drive accessories on automobiles . the best - known application is the vacuum ser ##vo , used to provide power assistance for the brakes . obsolete applications include vacuum - driven winds ##creen wipe ##rs and auto ##vac fuel pumps . some aircraft instruments ( attitude indicator ( ai ) and the heading indicator ( hi ) ) are typically vacuum - powered , as protection against loss of all ( electrically powered ) instruments , since early aircraft often did not have electrical systems , and since there are two readily available sources of vacuum on a moving aircraft — the engine and an external vent ##uri . vacuum induction melting uses electromagnetic induction within a vacuum .
obscure optical instruments [SEP] eva ##por ##ation and sub ##lim ##ation into a vacuum is called out ##gas ##sing . all materials , solid or liquid , have a small va ##pour pressure , and their out ##gas ##sing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this va ##pour pressure . in man - made systems , out ##gas ##sing has the same effect as a leak and can limit the ac ##hi ##eva ##ble vacuum . out ##gas ##sing products may conde ##nse on nearby colder surfaces , which can be troubles ##ome if they obscure optical instruments or react with other materials . this is of great concern to space missions , where an obscured telescope or solar cell can ruin an expensive mission .
because of the pressure differential [SEP] to continue eva ##cu ##ating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth , a compartment of the vacuum can be repeatedly closed off , exhausted , and expanded again . this is the principle behind positive displacement pumps , like the manual water pump for example . inside the pump , a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity to create a vacuum . because of the pressure differential , some fluid from the chamber ( or the well , in our example ) is pushed into the pump ' s small cavity . the pump ' s cavity is then sealed from the chamber , opened to the atmosphere , and squeezed back to a minute size .
gradual si ##lt build ##up [SEP] wang man ##g initiated a series of major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful . these reforms included outlaw ##ing slavery , national ##izing land to equally distribute between households , and introducing new cu ##rre ##ncies , a change which de ##base ##d the value of coinage . although these reforms provoked considerable opposition , wang ' s regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c . 3 ad and 11 ad . gradual si ##lt build ##up in the yellow river had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works . the yellow river split into two new branches : one empty ##ing to the north and the other to the south of the shandong peninsula , though han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 ad .

crust ##al deformation ##s [SEP] the atlantic coast of the united states is low , with minor exceptions . the appalachian highland owes its oblique northeast - southwest trend to crust ##al deformation ##s which in very early geological time gave a beginning to what later came to be the appalachian mountain system . this system had its climax of deformation so long ago ( probably in per ##mian time ) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief . it owes its present - day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or to the survival of the most resistant rocks as residual mountains . the oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern crust ##al movement , causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an en ##cr ##oa ##chment of the sea upon the land . additionally , the southeastern section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance of the land upon the sea .
value increased [SEP] the most expensive part of a cd is the jewel case . in 1995 , material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the cd . wholesale cost of cds was $ 0 . 75 to $ 1 . 15 , which retail ##ed for $ 16 . 98 . on average , the store received 35 percent of the retail price , the record company 27 percent , the artist 16 percent , the manufacturer 13 percent , and the distributor 9 percent . when 8 - track tapes , cassette tapes , and cds were introduced , each was marketed at a higher price than the format they succeeded , even though the cost to produce the media was reduced . this was done because the apparent value increased . this continued from vinyl to cds but was broken when apple marketed mp3 ##s for $ 0 . 99 , and albums for $ 9 . 99 . the inc ##rem ##ental cost , though , to produce an mp3 is very small .
disc rot [SEP] cd - r recordings are designed to be permanent . over time , the dye ' s physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods . the design life is from 20 to 100 years , depending on the quality of the discs , the quality of the writing drive , and storage conditions . however , testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions . this failure is known as disc rot , for which there are several , mostly environmental , reasons .
the controlled ( output ) power can be higher than the controlling ( input ) power [SEP] a trans ##isto ##r is a semiconductor device used to amp ##li ##fy or switch electronic signals and electrical power . it is composed of semiconductor material with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit . a voltage or current applied to one pair of the trans ##isto ##r ' s terminals changes the current through another pair of terminals . because the controlled ( output ) power can be higher than the controlling ( input ) power , a trans ##isto ##r can amp ##li ##fy a signal . today , some trans ##isto ##rs are packaged individually , but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits .
a contraction of the term trans ##res ##istan ##ce [SEP] from november 17 , 1947 to december 23 , 1947 , john bard ##een and walter brat ##tain at at & t ' s bell labs in the united states performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of german ##ium , a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input . solid state physics group leader william shock ##ley saw the potential in this , and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductor ##s . the term trans ##isto ##r was coined by john r . pierce as a contraction of the term trans ##res ##istan ##ce . according to lillian ho ##dd ##eson and vicki dai ##tch , authors of a biography of john bard ##een , shock ##ley had proposed that bell labs ' first patent for a trans ##isto ##r should be based on the field - effect and that he be named as the inventor . having unearthed lil ##ien ##feld ’ s patents that went into ob ##scu ##rity years earlier , lawyers at bell labs advised against shock ##ley ' s proposal because the idea of a field - effect trans ##isto ##r that used an electric field as a " grid " was not new . instead , what bard ##een , brat ##tain , and shock ##ley invented in 1947 was the first point - contact trans ##isto ##r . in acknowledge ##ment of this accomplishment , shock ##ley , bard ##een , and brat ##tain were jointly awarded the 1956 nobel prize in physics " for their researches on semiconductor ##s and their discovery of the trans ##isto ##r effect .

gain [SEP] the essential useful ##ness of a trans ##isto ##r comes from its ability to use a small signal applied between one pair of its terminals to control a much larger signal at another pair of terminals . this property is called gain . it can produce a stronger output signal , a voltage or current , which is proportional to a weaker input signal ; that is , it can act as an amplifier . alternatively , the trans ##isto ##r can be used to turn current on or off in a circuit as an electrically controlled switch , where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements .
reduced resistance from collector to emi ##tter [SEP] in a grounded - emi ##tter trans ##isto ##r circuit , such as the light - switch circuit shown , as the base voltage rises , the emi ##tter and collector currents rise exponential ##ly . the collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emi ##tter . if the voltage difference between the collector and emi ##tter were zero ( or near zero ) , the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance ( light bulb ) and the supply voltage . this is called sat ##uration because current is flowing from collector to emi ##tter freely . when saturated , the switch is said to be on .
the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance ( light bulb ) and the supply voltage [SEP] in a grounded - emi ##tter trans ##isto ##r circuit , such as the light - switch circuit shown , as the base voltage rises , the emi ##tter and collector currents rise exponential ##ly . the collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emi ##tter . if the voltage difference between the collector and emi ##tter were zero ( or near zero ) , the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance ( light bulb ) and the supply voltage . this is called sat ##uration because current is flowing from collector to emi ##tter freely . when saturated , the switch is said to be on .

their greater linear ##ity and ease of manufacture [SEP] the bipolar junction trans ##isto ##r ( b ##j ##t ) was the most commonly used trans ##isto ##r in the 1960s and 70s . even after mo ##sf ##ets became widely available , the b ##j ##t remained the trans ##isto ##r of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linear ##ity and ease of manufacture . in integrated circuits , the desirable properties of mo ##sf ##ets allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits . discrete mo ##sf ##ets can be applied in trans ##isto ##r applications , including analog circuits , voltage regulators , amplifiers , power transmitters and motor drivers .
less power is required to " drive " the trans ##isto ##r [SEP] the junction forward voltage is the voltage applied to the emi ##tter – base junction of a b ##j ##t in order to make the base conduct a specified current . the current increases exponential ##ly as the junction forward voltage is increased . the values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 ma ( the same values apply to semiconductor di ##odes ) . the lower the junction forward voltage the better , as this means that less power is required to " drive " the trans ##isto ##r . the junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature . for a typical silicon junction the change is − ##2 . 1 mv / °c . in some circuits special com ##pen ##sat ##ing elements ( sen ##sis ##tors ) must be used to compensate for such changes .
the european renaissance [SEP] the term " modern " was coined in the 16th century to indicate present or recent times ( ultimately derived from the latin ad ##ver ##b mod ##o , meaning " just now ) . the european renaissance ( about 142 ##0 – 1630 ) , which marked the transition between the late middle ages and early modern times , started in italy and was spurred in part by the red ##is ##co ##very of classical art and literature , as well as the new perspectives gained from the age of discovery and the invention of the telescope and microscope , expanding the borders of thought and knowledge .
the population grew [SEP] in china , urban ##ization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex . large urban centers , such as nanjing and beijing , also contributed to the growth of private industry . in particular , small - scale industries grew up , often specializing in paper , silk , cotton , and porcelain goods . for the most part , however , relatively small urban centers with markets pro ##life ##rated around the country . town markets mainly traded food , with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil . despite the x ##eno ##phobia and intellectual intro ##sp ##ection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo - con ##fu ##cian ##ism , china under the early ming dynasty was not isolated . foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world , particularly japan , increased considerably . chinese merchants explored all of the indian ocean , reaching east africa with the treasure voyages of zheng he .
beijing was captured by li z ##iche ##ng ' s peasant rebels [SEP] the qing dynasty ( 1644 – 1911 ) was founded after the fall of the ming , the last han chinese dynasty , by the manchu ##s . the manchu ##s were formerly known as the ju ##rch ##ens . when beijing was captured by li z ##iche ##ng ' s peasant rebels in 1644 , the chong ##zh ##en emperor , the last ming emperor , committed suicide . the manchu ##s then allied with former ming general wu sang ##ui and seized control of beijing , which became the new capital of the qing dynasty . the man ##cus adopted the con ##fu ##cian norms of traditional chinese government in their rule of china proper . sc ##hop ##pa , the editor of the columbia guide to modern chinese history argues , " a date around 1780 as the beginning of modern china is thus closer to what we know today as historical ' reality ' . it also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the pre ##ci ##pit ##ous decline of the chinese pol ##ity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .

nawab of bengal surrendered his dominion ##s to the british east india company [SEP] the development of new imperialism saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers . the commercial colonization of india commenced in 1757 , after the battle of pl ##asse ##y , when the nawab of bengal surrendered his dominion ##s to the british east india company , in 1765 , when the company was granted the di ##wani , or the right to collect revenue , in bengal and bihar , or in 1772 , when the company established a capital in calcutta , appointed its first governor - general , warren hastings , and became directly involved in governance .
the indian rebellion of 1857 and con ##se ##quent of the government of india act 1858 [SEP] the mara ##tha states , following the anglo - mara ##tha wars , eventually lost to the british east india company in 1818 with the third anglo - mara ##tha war . the rule lasted until 1858 , when , after the indian rebellion of 1857 and con ##se ##quent of the government of india act 1858 , the british government assumed the task of directly administering india in the new british raj . in 1819 stamford raf ##fles established singapore as a key trading post for britain in their rivalry with the dutch . however , their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an anglo - dutch treaty dem ##ar ##cated their respective interests in southeast asia . from the 1850s onwards , the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear .
execution of the king [SEP] the changes were accompanied by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the king , vast blood ##shed and repression during the reign of terror , and warfare involving every other major european power . subsequent events that can be traced to the revolution include the napoleonic wars , two separate restoration ##s of the monarchy , and two additional revolutions as modern france took shape . in the following century , france would be governed at one point or another as a republic , constitutional monarchy , and two different empires .
surge of republican ##ism [SEP] the campaigns of french emperor and general napoleon bonaparte characterized the napoleonic era . born on corsica as the french invaded , and dying suspiciously on the tiny british island of st . helena , this brilliant commander , controlled a french empire that , at its height , ruled a large portion of europe directly from paris , while many of his friends and family ruled countries such as spain , poland , several parts of italy and many other kingdoms republics and depend ##encies . the napoleonic era changed the face of europe forever , and old empires and kingdoms fell apart as a result of the mighty and " glorious " surge of republican ##ism .
the colonies first rejected the authority of the parliament to govern them without representation [SEP] beginning the age of revolution , the american revolution and the ensuing political up ##hea ##val during the last half of the 18th century saw the thirteen colonies of north america overthrow the governance of the parliament of great britain , and then reject the british monarchy itself to become the sovereign united states of america . in this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the parliament to govern them without representation , and formed self - governing independent states . the second continental congress then joined together against the british to defend that self - governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the american revolutionary war ( also called american war of independence ) .
development of steam - powered ships and railways [SEP] the first industrial revolution merged into the second industrial revolution around 1850 , when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam - powered ships and railways , and later in the 19th century with the internal combustion engine and electric power generation . the second industrial revolution was a phase of the industrial revolution ; labeled as the separate technical revolution . from a technological and a social point of view there is no clean break between the two . major innovations during the period occurred in the chemical , electrical , petroleum , and steel industries . specific advancement ##s included the introduction of oil fired steam turbine and internal combustion driven steel ships , the development of the airplane , the practical commercial ##ization of the automobile , mass production of consumer goods , the perfection of canning , mechanical ref ##ri ##ger ##ation and other food preservation techniques , and the invention of the telephone .
un ##chal ##len ##ged at sea [SEP] in britain ' s " imperial century " , victory over napoleon left britain without any serious international rival , other than russia in central asia . un ##chal ##len ##ged at sea , britain adopted the role of global policeman , a state of affairs later known as the pa ##x brit ##ann ##ica , and a foreign policy of " splendid isolation " . alongside the formal control it ex ##erted over its own colonies , britain ' s dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many nominally independent countries , such as china , argentina and siam , which has been generally characterized as " informal empire " . of note during this time was the anglo - zulu war , which was fought in 1879 between the british empire and the zulu empire .
exhibit a sphere of influence over the area [SEP] the major european powers laid claim to the areas of africa where they could exhibit a sphere of influence over the area . these claims did not have to have any substantial land holdings or treaties to be legitimate . the european power that demonstrated its control over a territory accepted the mandate to rule that region as a national colony . the european nation that held the claim developed and benefited from their colony ’ s commercial interests without having to fear rival european competition . with the colonial claim came the underlying assumption that the european power that ex ##erted control would use its mandate to offer protection and provide welfare for its colonial peoples , however , this principle remained more theory than practice . there were many documented instances of material and moral conditions deteriorating for native africans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under european colonial rule , to the point where the colonial experience for them has been described as " hell on earth . "
extravagant displays of wealth and excess of america ' s upper - class [SEP] during the gilded age , there was substantial growth in population in the united states and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of america ' s upper - class during the post - civil war and post - reconstruction era , in the late 19th century . the wealth polar ##ization derived primarily from industrial and population expansion . the businessmen of the second industrial revolution created industrial towns and cities in the northeast with new factories , and contributed to the creation of an ethnic ##ally diverse industrial working class which produced the wealth owned by rising super - rich industrialist ##s and fin ##an ##cier ##s called the " robber barons " . an example is the company of john d . rockefeller , who was an important figure in shaping the new oil industry . using highly effective tactics and aggressive practices , later widely criticized , standard oil absorbed or destroyed most of its competition .
as steps toward modernization [SEP] the assertion ##s of chinese philosophy began to integrate concepts of western philosophy , as steps toward modernization . by the time of the xi ##nh ##ai revolution in 1911 , there were many calls , such as the may fourth movement , to completely ab ##olis ##h the old imperial institutions and practices of china . there were attempts to incorporate democracy , republican ##ism , and industrial ##ism into chinese philosophy , notably by sun ya ##t - sen ( sun yi xi ##an , in one mandarin form of the name ) at the beginning of the 20th century . mao ze ##dong ( mao ze dong ) added marxist - lenin ##ist thought . when the communist party of china took over power , previous schools of thought , except ##ing notably legal ##ism , were denounced as backward , and later even purge ##d during the cultural revolution .
it to be sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic of the very de ##hum ##ani ##zation it was supposed to oppose [SEP] starting one - hundred years before the 20th century , the enlightenment spiritual philosophy was challenged in various quarters around the 1900s . developed from earlier secular traditions , modern humanist ethical phil ##oso ##phi ##es affirmed the dignity and worth of all people , based on the ability to determine right and wrong by appealing to universal human qualities , particularly rational ##ity , without resort ##ing to the supernatural or alleged divine authority from religious texts . for liberal humanist ##s such as rousseau and kant , the universal law of reason guided the way toward total emancipation from any kind of ty ##ran ##ny . these ideas were challenged , for example by the young karl marx , who criticized the project of political emancipation ( embodied in the form of human rights ) , asserting it to be sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic of the very de ##hum ##ani ##zation it was supposed to oppose . for friedrich nietzsche , human ##ism was nothing more than a secular version of the ##ism . in his genealogy of morals , he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively con ##stra ##in the strong . on this view , such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life , but rather deny it . in the 20th century , the notion that human beings are rational ##ly autonomous was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational desires .

either imprisoned or executed outright . [SEP] the last days of the qing dynasty were marked by civil unrest and foreign invasions . responding to these civil failures and discontent , the qing imperial court did attempt to reform the government in various ways , such as the decision to draft a constitution in 1906 , the establishment of provincial legislatures in 1909 , and the preparation for a national parliament in 1910 . however , many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the qing court , and many reformer ##s were either imprisoned or executed outright . the failures of the imperial court to en ##act such reforming measures of political liberal ##ization and modernization caused the reform ##ists to steer toward the road of revolution .

shifting alliances of china ' s regional warlord ##s wage ##d war for control of the beijing government . [SEP] after the early 20th century revolutions , shifting alliances of china ' s regional warlord ##s wage ##d war for control of the beijing government . despite the fact that various warlord ##s gained control of the government in beijing during the warlord era , this did not constitute a new era of control or governance , because other warlord ##s did not acknowledge the transit ##ory governments in this period and were a law unto themselves . these military - dominated governments were collectively known as the bei ##yang government . the warlord era ended around 1927 .

over manchu ##ria and korea . [SEP] four years into the 20th century saw the russo - japanese war with the battle of port arthur establishing the empire of japan as a world power . the russians were in constant pursuit of a warm water port on the pacific ocean , for their navy as well as for maritime trade . the manchu ##rian campaign of the russian empire was fought against the japanese over manchu ##ria and korea . the major theatres of operations were southern manchu ##ria , specifically the area around the lia ##odon ##g peninsula and mu ##k ##den , and the seas around korea , japan , and the yellow sea . the resulting campaigns , in which the fledgling japanese military consistently attained victory over the russian forces array ##ed against them , were unexpected by world observers . these victories , as time trans ##pired , would dramatically transform the distribution of power in east asia , resulting in a re ##asse ##ss ##ment of japan ' s recent entry onto the world stage . the embarrassing string of defeats increased russian popular dissatisfaction with the in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt and corrupt tsar ##ist government .
over the division of the spoil ##s [SEP] however , the crisis did not exist in a void ; it came after a long series of diplomatic clashes between the great powers over european and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914 which had left tensions high . the diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in europe since 1870 . an example is the baghdad railway which was planned to connect the ottoman empire cities of ko ##nya and baghdad with a line through modern - day turkey , syria and iraq . the railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding world war i . although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began , it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the first world war . fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the balkans . austria - hungary competed with serbia and russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties . the balkan wars were two wars in south - eastern europe in 1912 – 1913 in the course of which the balkan league ( bulgaria , montenegro , greece , and serbia ) first captured ottoman - held remaining part of the ##ssa ##ly , macedonia , ep ##irus , albania and most of th ##race and then fell out over the division of the spoil ##s , with incorporation of romania this time .
the russian provisional government was established . [SEP] the russian revolution is the series of revolutions in russia in 1917 , which destroyed the tsar ##ist auto ##cr ##acy and led to the creation of the soviet union . following the abd ##ication of nicholas ii of russia , the russian provisional government was established . in october 1917 , a red faction revolution occurred in which the red guard , armed groups of workers and desert ##ing soldiers directed by the bolshevik party , seized control of saint petersburg ( then known as pet ##ro ##grad ) and began an immediate armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former russian empire .

virtually halted in many countries [SEP] the depression had devastating effects in virtually every country , rich or poor . international trade plunged by half to two - thirds , as did personal income , tax revenue , prices and profits . cities all around the world were hit hard , especially those dependent on heavy industry . construction was virtually halted in many countries . farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by roughly 60 percent . facing plum ##met ##ing demand with few alternate sources of jobs , areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most .
the gulf between the world ' s rich and poor grew wider [SEP] over the course of the 20th century , the world ' s per - capita gross domestic product grew by a factor of five , much more than all earlier centuries combined ( including the 19th with its industrial revolution ) . many economists make the case that this under ##sta ##tes the magnitude of growth , as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century , such as improved medicine ( causing world life expect ##ancy to increase by more than two decades ) and communications technologies , were not available at any price at its beginning . however , the gulf between the world ' s rich and poor grew wider , and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide .
in the 1970s , leftist ##s acquired a significant political influence [SEP] in latin america in the 1970s , leftist ##s acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right - wing , ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of the individual country ' s upper class to support coup d ' etat ##s to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat . this was further fueled by cuban and united states intervention which led to a political polar ##ization . most south american countries were in some periods ruled by military dictatorship ##s that were supported by the united states of america . in the 1970s , the regimes of the southern cone collaborated in operation condor killing many leftist di ##ssi ##dents , including some urban guerrillas . however , by the early 1990s all countries had restored their demo ##cr ##acies .

the president would be asked to submit legislation to congress to admit puerto rico as a state [SEP] on may 15 , 2013 , resident commissioner pier ##lu ##isi introduced h . r . 2000 to congress to " set forth the process for puerto rico to be admitted as a state of the union , " asking for congress to vote on rat ##ifying puerto rico as the 51st state . on february 12 , 2014 , senator martin heinrich introduced a bill in the us senate . the bill would require a binding referendum to be held in puerto rico asking whether the territory wants to be admitted as a state . in the event of a yes vote , the president would be asked to submit legislation to congress to admit puerto rico as a state .
virginia reclaimed the portion of the district south of the potomac [SEP] washington , d . c . is often mentioned as a candidate for statehood . in federal ##ist no . 43 of the federal ##ist papers , james madison considered the implications of the definition of the " seat of government " found in the united states constitution . although he noted potential conflicts of interest , and the need for a " municipal legislature for local purposes , " madison did not address the district ' s role in national voting . legal scholars disagree on whether a simple act of congress can admit the district as a state , due to its status as the seat of government of the united states , which article i , section 8 of the constitution requires to be under the exclusive jurisdiction of congress ; depending on the interpretation of this text , admission of the full district as a state may require a constitutional amendment , which is much more difficult to en ##act . however , the constitution does not set a minimum size for the district . its size has already changed once before , when virginia reclaimed the portion of the district south of the potomac . so the constitutional requirement for a federal district can be satisfied by reducing its size to the small central core of government buildings and monuments , giving the rest of the territory to the new state .
the annual funding and defense support it receives from the united states [SEP] several websites assert that israel is the 51st state due to the annual funding and defense support it receives from the united states . an example of this concept can be found in 2003 when martin ##e roth ##bla ##tt published a book called two stars for peace that argued for the addition of israel and the palestinian territories surrounding it as the 51st state in the union . the american state of can ##aan , is a book published by prof . alfred de graz ##ia , political science and sociologist , in march 2009 , proposing the creation of the 51st and 52nd states from israel and the palestinian territories .
as a defense for japan . [SEP] in article 3 of the treaty of san francisco between the allied powers and japan , which came into force in april 1952 , the u . s . put the outlying islands of the ryu ##kyu ##s , including the island of okinawa — home to over 1 million okinawa ##ns related to the japanese — and the bon ##in islands , the volcano islands , and i ##wo jim ##a into u . s . trustees ##hip . all these trustees ##hips were slowly returned to japanese rule . okinawa was returned on may 15 , 1972 , but the u . s . stations troops in the island ' s bases as a defense for japan .
achieve directional ##ity [SEP] at low frequencies ( such as am broadcast ) , arrays of vertical towers are used to achieve directional ##ity and they will occupy large areas of land . for reception , a long beverage antenna can have significant direct ##ivity . for non directional portable use , a short vertical antenna or small loop antenna works well , with the main design challenge being that of imp ##edance matching . with a vertical antenna a loading coil at the base of the antenna may be employed to cancel the reactive component of imp ##edance ; small loop antennas are tuned with parallel cap ##ac ##itors for this purpose .
imp ##edance match [SEP] although a res ##ona ##nt antenna has a purely resist ##ive feed - point imp ##edance at a particular frequency , many ( if not most ) applications require using an antenna over a range of frequencies . an antenna ' s bandwidth specifies the range of frequencies over which its performance does not suffer due to a poor imp ##edance match . also in the case of a ya ##gi - ud ##a array , the use of the antenna very far away from its design frequency reduces the antenna ' s direct ##ivity , thus reducing the usable bandwidth regardless of imp ##edance matching .
heat [SEP] efficiency of a transmitting antenna is the ratio of power actually radiated ( in all directions ) to the power absorbed by the antenna terminals . the power supplied to the antenna terminals which is not radiated is converted into heat . this is usually through loss resistance in the antenna ' s conductors , but can also be due to die ##le ##ctric or magnetic core losses in antennas ( or antenna systems ) using such components . such loss effectively rob ##s power from the transmitter , requiring a stronger transmitter in order to transmit a signal of a given strength .

" t ##we ##ak " the match [SEP] maximum power transfer requires matching the imp ##edance of an antenna system ( as seen looking into the transmission line ) to the complex con ##ju ##gate of the imp ##edance of the receiver or transmitter . in the case of a transmitter , however , the desired matching imp ##edance might not correspond to the dynamic output imp ##edance of the transmitter as analyzed as a source imp ##edance but rather the design value ( typically 50 oh ##ms ) required for efficient and safe operation of the transmitting circuit ##ry . the intended imp ##edance is normally resist ##ive but a transmitter ( and some receivers ) may have additional adjustments to cancel a certain amount of react ##ance in order to " t ##we ##ak " the match . when a transmission line is used in between the antenna and the transmitter ( or receiver ) one generally would like an antenna system whose imp ##edance is resist ##ive and near the characteristic imp ##edance of that transmission line in order to minimize the standing wave ratio ( sw ##r ) and the increase in transmission line losses it en ##tails , in addition to supplying a good match at the transmitter or receiver itself .
reduced power [SEP] the actual antenna which is transmitting the original wave then also may receive a strong signal from its own image from the ground . this will induce an additional current in the antenna element , changing the current at the feed ##point for a given feed ##point voltage . thus the antenna ' s imp ##edance , given by the ratio of feed ##point voltage to current , is altered due to the antenna ' s proximity to the ground . this can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground . but as the antenna height is increased , the reduced power of the reflected wave ( due to the inverse square law ) allows the antenna to approach its as ##ym ##pt ##otic feed ##point imp ##edance given by theory . at lower heights , the effect on the antenna ' s imp ##edance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground , as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna . changing the antenna ' s height by a quarter wavelength , then changes the phase of the reflection by 180 ##° , with a completely different effect on the antenna ' s imp ##edance .
low radiation resistance [SEP] loop antennas consist of a loop or coil of wire . loops with ci ##rc ##um ##ference of a wavelength or larger act similarly to dip ##ole antennas . however loops small in comparison to a wavelength act differently . they interact with the magnetic field of the radio wave instead of the electric field as other antennas do , and so are relatively ins ##ens ##itive to nearby electrical noise . however they have low radiation resistance , and so are in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt for transmitting . they are used as receiving antennas at low frequencies , and also as direction finding antennas .
sy ##mb ##iot ##ic companion plant relationships [SEP] flower evolution continues to the present day ; modern flowers have been so profoundly influenced by humans that some of them cannot be poll ##inated in nature . many modern domestic ##ated flower species were formerly simple weeds , which sp ##routed only when the ground was disturbed . some of them tended to grow with human crops , perhaps already having sy ##mb ##iot ##ic companion plant relationships with them , and the pre ##tti ##est did not get plucked because of their beauty , developing a dependence upon and special adaptation to human affection .
reduce or prevent self - fe ##rti ##lization [SEP] while the majority of flowers are perfect or her ##ma ##ph ##rod ##ite ( having both pollen and o ##vu ##le producing parts in the same flower structure ) , flowering plants have developed numerous morphological and physiological mechanisms to reduce or prevent self - fe ##rti ##lization . het ##ero ##morphic flowers have short carp ##els and long st ##amen ##s , or vice versa , so animal poll ##inator ##s cannot easily transfer pollen to the pi ##sti ##l ( rec ##eptive part of the carp ##el ) . homo ##morphic flowers may employ a bio ##chemical ( physiological ) mechanism called self - inc ##omp ##ati ##bility to disc ##rim ##inate between self and non - self pollen grains . in other species , the male and female parts are morphological ##ly separated , developing on different flowers .

the board of trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided missouri [SEP] during the three years following its inception , the university bore three different names . the board first approved " eliot seminary , " but william eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary , which would implicit ##ly be charged with teaching a religious faith . he favored a non ##se ##cta ##rian university . in 1854 , the board of trustees changed the name to " washington institute " in honor of george washington . naming the university after the nation ' s first president , only seven years before the american civil war and during a time of bitter national division , was no coincidence . during this time of conflict , americans universally admired george washington as the father of the united states and a symbol of national unity . the board of trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided missouri . in 1856 , the university amended its name to " washington university . " the university amended its name once more in 1976 , when the board of trustees voted to add the suffix " in st . louis " to distinguish the university from the nearly two dozen other universities bearing washington ' s name .
to accommodate the 1904 world ' s fair and olympics [SEP] in 1899 , the university opened a national design contest for the new campus . the renowned philadelphia firm cope & steward ##son won unanimously with its plan for a row of collegiate gothic quad ##rangle ##s inspired by oxford and cambridge universities . the cornerstone of the first building , busch hall , was laid on october 20 , 1900 . the construction of brook ##ings hall , rid ##gley , and cup ##ples began shortly thereafter . the school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the 1904 world ' s fair and olympics . the delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned . this original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the dan ##forth campus ; cope & steward ##son ’ s original plan and its choice of building materials have , with few exceptions , guided the construction and expansion of the dan ##forth campus to the present day .
scheduling difficulties between the candidates [SEP] washington university has been selected by the commission on presidential debates to host more presidential and vice - presidential debates than any other institution in history . united states presidential election debates were held at the washington university athletic complex in 1992 , 2000 , 2004 , and 2016 . a presidential debate was planned to occur in 1996 , but owing to scheduling difficulties between the candidates , the debate was canceled . the university hosted the only 2008 vice presidential debate , between republican sarah pali ##n and democrat joe bid ##en , on october 2 , 2008 , also at the washington university athletic complex .
complex , subjective phenomenon [SEP] pain is a distress ##ing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli , such as stu ##bbing a toe , burning a finger , putting alcohol on a cut , and bump ##ing the " funny bone " . because it is a complex , subjective phenomenon , defining pain has been a challenge . the international association for the study of pain ' s widely used definition states : " pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage , or described in terms of such damage . " in medical diagnosis , pain is a sy ##mpt ##om .
may relieve pain [SEP] local an ##est ##hetic injection ##s into the nerves or sensitive areas of the stump may relieve pain for days , weeks , or sometimes permanently , despite the drug wearing off in a matter of hours ; and small injection ##s of hyper ##tonic saline into the soft tissue between vertebrae produces local pain that ra ##dia ##tes into the phantom limb for ten minutes or so and may be followed by hours , weeks or even longer of partial or total relief from phantom pain . vigorous vibration or electrical stimulation of the stump , or current from electrode ##s surgical ##ly implant ##ed onto the spinal cord , all produce relief in some patients .
serious spinal cord damage , [SEP] para ##ple ##gia , the loss of sensation and voluntary motor control after serious spinal cord damage , may be accompanied by gi ##rd ##le pain at the level of the spinal cord damage , vis ##cera ##l pain ev ##oked by a filling bladder or bow ##el , or , in five to ten per cent of para ##ple ##gic ##s , phantom body pain in areas of complete sensory loss . this phantom body pain is initially described as burning or tingling but may evolve into severe crushing or pinch ##ing pain , or the sensation of fire running down the legs or of a knife twisting in the flesh . onset may be immediate or may not occur until years after the di ##sa ##bling injury . surgical treatment rarely provides lasting relief .
repeated damage to their tongues , eyes , joints , skin , and muscles [SEP] a much smaller number of people are ins ##ens ##itive to pain due to an in ##born abnormal ##ity of the nervous system , known as " congenital ins ##ens ##iti ##vity to pain " . children with this condition inc ##ur careless ##ly - repeated damage to their tongues , eyes , joints , skin , and muscles . some die before adulthood , and others have a reduced life expect ##ancy . [ citation needed ] most people with congenital ins ##ens ##iti ##vity to pain have one of five hereditary sensory and auto ##no ##mic ne ##uro ##path ##ies ( which includes fa ##mi ##lia ##l d ##ys ##au ##ton ##omi ##a and congenital ins ##ens ##iti ##vity to pain with an ##hid ##rosis ) . these conditions feature decreased sensitivity to pain together with other neurological abnormalities , particularly of the auto ##no ##mic nervous system . a very rare syndrome with isolated congenital ins ##ens ##iti ##vity to pain has been linked with mutations in the sc ##n ##9 ##a gene , which codes for a sodium channel ( na ##v ##1 . 7 ) necessary in conducting pain nerve stimuli .
superseded by more modern theories of pain [SEP] in 1955 , dc sinclair and g wed ##dell developed peripheral pattern theory , based on a 1934 suggestion by john paul na ##fe . they proposed that all skin fiber endings ( with the exception of those inner ##vating hair cells ) are identical , and that pain is produced by intense stimulation of these fibers . another 20th - century theory was gate control theory , introduced by ronald mel ##za ##ck and patrick wall in the 1965 science article " pain mechanisms : a new theory " . the authors proposed that both thin ( pain ) and large diameter ( touch , pressure , vibration ) nerve fibers carry information from the site of injury to two destinations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord , and that the more large fiber activity relative to thin fiber activity at the inhibitor ##y cell , the less pain is felt . both peripheral pattern theory and gate control theory have been superseded by more modern theories of pain [ citation needed ] .
interest in a standard [SEP] as computers grew in speed and capability , a number of general - purpose database systems emerged ; by the mid - 1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use . interest in a standard began to grow , and charles bach ##man , author of one such product , the integrated data store ( id ##s ) , founded the " database task group " within cod ##as ##yl , the group responsible for the creation and standardization of co ##bol . in 1971 the database task group delivered their standard , which generally became known as the " cod ##as ##yl approach " , and soon a number of commercial products based on this approach entered the market .
not be placed in the database [SEP] for instance , a common use of a database system is to track information about users , their name , log ##in information , various addresses and phone numbers . in the navigation ##al approach all of this data would be placed in a single record , and unused items would simply not be placed in the database . in the relational approach , the data would be normal ##ized into a user table , an address table and a phone number table ( for instance ) . records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided .
lightweight and easy for any computer user to understand out of the box [SEP] the 1980s ushered in the age of desktop computing . the new computers empowered their users with spreads ##hee ##ts like lotus 1 - 2 - 3 and database software like db ##ase . the db ##ase product was lightweight and easy for any computer user to understand out of the box . c . wayne rat ##li ##ff the creator of db ##ase stated : " db ##ase was different from programs like basic , c , fort ##ran , and co ##bol in that a lot of the dirty work had already been done . the data manipulation is done by db ##ase instead of by the user , so the user can concentrate on what he is doing , rather than having to mess with the dirty details of opening , reading , and closing files , and managing space allocation . " db ##ase was one of the top selling software titles in the 1980s and early 1990s .

primarily economical [SEP] a database built with one db ##ms is not portable to another db ##ms ( i . e . , the other db ##ms cannot run it ) . however , in some situations it is desirable to move , migrate a database from one db ##ms to another . the reasons are primarily economical ( different db ##ms ##s may have different total costs of ownership or tc ##os ) , functional , and operational ( different db ##ms ##s may have different capabilities ) . the migration involves the database ' s transformation from one db ##ms type to another . the transformation should maintain ( if possible ) the database related application ( i . e . , all related application programs ) intact . thus , the database ' s conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation . it may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained . a complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly ( one - time ) project by itself , which should be factor ##ed into the decision to migrate . this in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific db ##ms ##s . typically a db ##ms vendor provides tools to help import ##ing databases from other popular db ##ms ##s .
the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage [SEP] tucson was probably first visited by pale ##o - indians , known to have been in southern arizona about 12 , 000 years ago . recent archaeological excavations near the santa cruz river have located a village site dating from 210 ##0 bc . [ citation needed ] the flood ##pl ##ain of the santa cruz river was extensively farm ##ed during the early agricultural period , circa 1200 bc to ad 150 . these people constructed irrigation canals and grew corn , beans , and other crops while gathering wild plants and hunting . the early ceramic period occupation of tucson saw the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage . the groups designated as the ho ##ho ##kam lived in the area from ad 600 to 145 ##0 and are known for their vast irrigation canal systems and their red - on - brown pottery .

in honor of the university of arizona [SEP] on sentinel peak ( also known as " ' a ' mountain " ) , just west of downtown , there is a giant " a " in honor of the university of arizona . starting in about 1916 , a yearly tradition developed for freshmen to white ##wash the " a " , which was visible for miles . however , at the beginning of the iraq war , anti - war activists painted it black . this was followed by a paint sc ##uf ##fle where the " a " was painted various colors until the city council intervened . it is now red , white and blue except when it is white or another color decided by a biennial election . because of the three - color paint scheme often used , the shape of the a can be vague and ind ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hab ##le from the rest of the peak . the top of sentinel peak , which is accessible by road , offers an outstanding scenic view of the city looking eastward . a parking lot located near the summit of sentinel peak was formerly a popular place to watch sunset ##s or view the city lights at night .
awaiting the building of a new stadium in es ##con ##di ##do [SEP] the tucson padres played at kin ##o veterans memorial stadium from 2011 to 2013 . they served as the aaa affiliate of the san diego padres . the team , formerly known as the portland beaver ##s , was temporarily relocated to tucson from portland while awaiting the building of a new stadium in es ##con ##di ##do . legal issues der ##ailed the plans to build the es ##con ##di ##do stadium , so they moved to el paso , texas for the 2014 season . previously , the tucson side ##wind ##ers , a triple - a affiliate of the arizona diamond ##backs , won the pacific coast league championship and unofficial aaa championship in 2006 . the side ##wind ##ers played in tucson electric park and were in the pacific conference south of the pc ##l . the side ##wind ##ers were sold in 2007 and moved to reno , nevada after the 2008 season . they now compete as the reno aces .
its flat terrain and dry climate [SEP] cycling is popular in tucson due to its flat terrain and dry climate . tucson and pi ##ma county maintain an extensive network of marked bike routes , signal crossings , on - street bike lanes , mountain - biking trails , and dedicated shared - use paths . the loop is a network of seven linear parks comprising over 100 mi ( 160 km ) of paved , vehicle - free trails that en ##ci ##rcle ##s the majority of the city with links to mara ##na and oro valley . the tucson - pi ##ma county bicycle advisory committee ( t ##pc ##ba ##c ) serves in an advisory capacity to local governments on issues relating to bicycle recreation , transportation , and safety . tucson was awarded a gold rating for bicycle - friend ##liness by the league of american bi ##cy ##cl ##ists in 2006 .
as a deter ##rent against turkey [SEP] due to its position between two un ##fr ##ien ##dly neighbours , armenia has close security ties with russia . at the request of the armenian government , russia maintains a military base in the northwestern armenian city of g ##yu ##m ##ri as a deter ##rent against turkey . [ citation needed ] despite this , armenia has also been looking toward euro - atlantic structures in recent years . it maintains good relations with the united states especially through its armenian diaspora . according to the us census bureau , there are 42 ##7 , 82 ##2 armenians living in the country .
food security needs [SEP] agriculture accounted for less than 20 % of both net material product and total employment before the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . after independence , the importance of agriculture in the economy increased markedly , its share at the end of the 1990s rising to more than 30 % of gdp and more than 40 % of total employment . this increase in the importance of agriculture was at ##tri ##bu ##table to food security needs of the population in the face of uncertainty during the first phases of transition and the collapse of the non - agricultural sectors of the economy in the early 1990s . as the economic situation stabilized and growth resumed , the share of agriculture in gdp dropped to slightly over 20 % ( 2006 data ) , although the share of agriculture in employment remained more than 40 % .
most organisms were microscopic [SEP] the ancestors of modern bacteria were un ##ice ##ll ##ular micro ##org ##ani ##sms that were the first forms of life to appear on earth , about 4 billion years ago . for about 3 billion years , most organisms were microscopic , and bacteria and arch ##aea were the dominant forms of life . in 2008 , fossils of macro ##org ##ani ##sms were discovered and named as the france ##vill ##ian bio ##ta . although bacterial fossils exist , such as st ##rom ##ato ##lite ##s , their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution , or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species . however , gene sequences can be used to rec ##ons ##truct the bacterial ph ##yl ##ogen ##y , and these studies indicate that bacteria diver ##ged first from the arch ##aea ##l / eu ##kar ##yo ##tic lineage . bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary diver ##gence , that of the arch ##aea and eu ##kar ##yo ##tes . here , eu ##kar ##yo ##tes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into end ##os ##ym ##biotic associations with the ancestors of eu ##kar ##yo ##tic cells , which were themselves possibly related to the arch ##aea . this involved the eng ##ulf ##ment by proto - eu ##kar ##yo ##tic cells of alpha ##pro ##te ##ob ##act ##eria ##l sy ##mb ##ion ##ts to form either mit ##och ##ond ##ria or hydrogen ##oso ##mes , which are still found in all known eu ##kar ##ya ( sometimes in highly reduced form , e . g . in ancient " ami ##to ##chon ##dr ##ial " proto ##zo ##a ) . later on , some eu ##kar ##yo ##tes that already contained mit ##och ##ond ##ria also engulfed cy ##ano ##ba ##cter ##ial - like organisms . this led to the formation of ch ##lor ##op ##las ##ts in algae and plants . there are also some algae that originated from even later end ##os ##ym ##biotic events . here , eu ##kar ##yo ##tes engulfed a eu ##kar ##yo ##tic algae that developed into a " second - generation " pl ##ast ##id . this is known as secondary end ##os ##ym ##bio ##sis .
aggregate to form fruit ##ing bodies [SEP] even more complex morphological changes are sometimes possible . for example , when starved of amino acids , my ##x ##ob ##act ##eria detect surrounding cells in a process known as quo ##rum sensing , migrate toward each other , and aggregate to form fruit ##ing bodies up to 500 micro ##met ##res long and containing approximately 100 , 000 bacterial cells . in these fruit ##ing bodies , the bacteria perform separate tasks ; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multi ##cellular organisation . for example , about one in 10 cells migrate to the top of these fruit ##ing bodies and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called my ##x ##os ##pore ##s , which are more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions than are ordinary cells .
nutrients are limited [SEP] most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheap ##ly and quickly . however , in natural environments , nutrients are limited , meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely . this nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies ( see r / k selection theory ) . some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available , such as the formation of al ##gal ( and cy ##ano ##ba ##cter ##ial ) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer . other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments , such as the production of multiple antibiotics by st ##re ##pt ##omy ##ces that inhibit the growth of competing micro ##org ##ani ##sms . in nature , many organisms live in communities ( e . g . , bio ##film ##s ) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses . these relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms ( syn ##tro ##phy ) .
changes to their genetic material dna [SEP] bacteria , as as ##ex ##ual organisms , inherit identical copies of their parent ' s genes ( i . e . , they are cl ##onal ) . however , all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material dna caused by genetic rec ##om ##bina ##tion or mutations . mutations come from errors made during the replication of dna or from exposure to mu ##tage ##ns . mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria . genetic changes in bacterial genome ##s come from either random mutation during replication or " stress - directed mutation " , where genes involved in a particular growth - limiting process have an increased mutation rate .
bacteria kill and then consume other micro ##org ##ani ##sms [SEP] some species of bacteria kill and then consume other micro ##org ##ani ##sms , these species are called predatory bacteria . these include organisms such as my ##x ##oco ##ccus x ##ant ##hus , which forms swarm ##s of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter . other bacterial predators either attach to their prey in order to digest them and absorb nutrients , such as vamp ##iro ##vi ##bri ##o ch ##lore ##lla ##vor ##us , or invade another cell and multi ##ply inside the cy ##tos ##ol , such as da ##pt ##ob ##act ##er . these predatory bacteria are thought to have evolved from sap ##rop ##ha ##ges that consumed dead micro ##org ##ani ##sms , through adaptations that allowed them to en ##tra ##p and kill other organisms .
ox ##idi ##zes [SEP] matt ##e sold ##er is usually fused to provide a better bonding surface or stripped to bare copper . treatments , such as benz ##imi ##da ##zo ##let ##hi ##ol , prevent surface oxidation of bare copper . the places to which components will be mounted are typically plate ##d , because un ##tre ##ated bare copper ox ##idi ##zes quickly , and therefore is not readily sold ##era ##ble . traditionally , any exposed copper was coated with sold ##er by hot air sold ##er level ##ling ( has ##l ) . the has ##l finish prevents oxidation from the underlying copper , thereby guarantee ##ing a sold ##era ##ble surface . this sold ##er was a tin - lead alloy , however new sold ##er compounds are now used to achieve compliance with the ro ##hs directive in the eu and us , which restrict ##s the use of lead . one of these lead - free compounds is s ##n ##100 ##cl , made up of 99 . 3 % tin , 0 . 7 % copper , 0 . 05 % nickel , and a nominal of 60 ##pp ##m german ##ium .
the fall of constantinople to the crusaders of the fourth crusade in 120 ##4 [SEP] a distinct greek political identity re - emerged in the 11th century in educated circles and became more forceful after the fall of constantinople to the crusaders of the fourth crusade in 120 ##4 , so that when the empire was revived in 126 ##1 , it became in many ways a greek national state . that new notion of nation ##hood eng ##end ##ered a deep interest in the classical past culminating in the ideas of the neo ##pl ##aton ##ist philosopher gem ##ist ##us pl ##eth ##o , who abandoned christianity . however , it was the combination of orthodox christianity with a specifically greek identity that shaped the greeks ' notion of themselves in the empire ' s twilight years . the interest in the classical greek heritage was complement ##ed by a renewed emphasis on greek orthodox identity , which was reinforced in the late medieval and ottoman greeks ' links with their fellow orthodox christians in the russian empire . these were further strengthened following the fall of the empire of tre ##bi ##zon ##d in 146 ##1 , after which and until the second russo - turkish war of 1828 - 29 hundreds of thousands of pont ##ic greeks fled or migrated from the pont ##ic alps and armenian highlands to southern russia and the russian south caucasus ( see also greeks in russia , greeks in armenia , greeks in georgia , and caucasian greeks ) .
the previously called gr ##ai ##ko ##i were named hell ##enes . [SEP] in the he ##sio ##dic catalogue of women , gr ##ae ##cus is presented as the son of zeus and pandora ii , sister of hell ##en the patriarch of hell ##enes . hell ##en was the son of de ##uca ##lion who ruled around ph ##thi ##a in central greece . the par ##ian chronicle mentions that when de ##uca ##lion became king of ph ##thi ##a , the previously called gr ##ai ##ko ##i were named hell ##enes . aristotle notes that the hell ##enes were related with gr ##ai / greeks ( meteor ##olo ##gic ##a i . xiv ) a native name of a dorian tribe in ep ##irus which was used by the ill ##yria ##ns . he also claims that the great del ##uge must have occurred in the region around dod ##ona , where the sell ##oi d ##we ##lt . however , according to the greek tradition it is more possible that the homeland of the greeks was originally in central greece . a modern theory derives the name greek ( latin gr ##ae ##ci ) from gr ##ai ##kos , " inhabit ##ant of gr ##aia / gr ##aea , " a town on the coast of bo ##eo ##tia . greek colonists from gr ##aia helped to found cum ##ae ( 900 bc ) in italy , where they were called gr ##ae ##ces . when the romans encountered them they used this name for the colonists and then for all greeks ( gr ##ae ##ci . ) the word γ ##ρ ##α ##ια gr ##aia " old woman " comes from the pie root * ge ##rh ##2 - / * gr ##eh ##2 - , " to grow old " via proto - greek * ge ##ra - / gr ##au - i ##u ; the same root later gave γ ##ε ##ρ ##α ##ς ge ##ras ( / ke ##ras / ) , " gift of honour " in my ##cene ##an greek . the germanic languages borrowed the word greeks with an initial " k " sound which probably was their initial sound closest to the latin " g " at the time ( goth . k ##rek ##s ) . the area out of ancient attic ##a including bo ##eo ##tia was called gr ##ai ##ke and is connected with the older del ##uge of og ##y ##ges , the mythological ruler of bo ##eo ##tia . the region was originally occupied by the min ##yan ##s who were auto ##cht ##hon ##ous or proto - greek speaking people . in ancient greek the name og ##y ##gio ##s came to mean " from earliest days " .
stadiums were crumbling , supporters endured poor facilities , ho ##oli ##gan ##ism was ri ##fe [SEP] despite significant european success during the 1970s and early 1980s , the late ' 80s had marked a low point for english football . stadiums were crumbling , supporters endured poor facilities , ho ##oli ##gan ##ism was ri ##fe , and english clubs were banned from european competition for five years following the hey ##sel stadium disaster in 1985 . the football league first division , which had been the top level of english football since 1888 , was well behind leagues such as italy ' s serie a and spain ' s la liga in attendance ##s and revenues , and several top english players had moved abroad .
english clubs were banned from european competition for five years following the hey ##sel stadium disaster in 1985 . [SEP] despite significant european success during the 1970s and early 1980s , the late ' 80s had marked a low point for english football . stadiums were crumbling , supporters endured poor facilities , ho ##oli ##gan ##ism was ri ##fe , and english clubs were banned from european competition for five years following the hey ##sel stadium disaster in 1985 . the football league first division , which had been the top level of english football since 1888 , was well behind leagues such as italy ' s serie a and spain ' s la liga in attendance ##s and revenues , and several top english players had moved abroad .
to capital ##ise on the growing influx of money being pumped into the sport . [SEP] television money had also become much more important ; the football league received £ ##6 . 3 million for a two - year agreement in 1986 , but when that deal was renewed in 1988 , the price rose to £ ##44 million over four years . the 1988 negotiations were the first signs of a breakaway league ; ten clubs threatened to leave and form a " super league " , but were eventually persuaded to stay . as stadiums improved and match attendance and revenues rose , the country ' s top teams again considered leaving the football league in order to capital ##ise on the growing influx of money being pumped into the sport .
the meeting was to pa ##ve the way for a break away from the football league . [SEP] the managing director of london weekend television ( l ##wt ) , greg dyke , met with the representatives of the " big five " football clubs in england in 1990 . the meeting was to pa ##ve the way for a break away from the football league . dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for l ##wt if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money . the five clubs decided it was a good idea and decided to press ahead with it ; however , the league would have no credibility without the backing of the football association and so david dei ##n of arsenal held talks to see whether the fa were rec ##eptive to the idea . the fa did not enjoy an ami ##cable relationship with the football league at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the football league ' s position .

kevin ke ##egan stated that " big four " dominance threatened the division , [SEP] one significant feature of the premier league in the mid - 2000s was the dominance of the so - called " big four " clubs : arsenal , chelsea , liverpool and manchester united . during this decade , and particularly from 2002 to 2009 , they dominated the top four spots , which came with uefa champions league qualification , taking all top four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003 – 04 to 2008 – 09 inclusive , with arsenal going as far as winning the league without losing a single game in 2003 – 04 , the only time it has ever happened in the premier league . in may 2008 kevin ke ##egan stated that " big four " dominance threatened the division , " this league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world . " premier league chief executive richard sc ##uda ##more said in defence : " there are a lot of different tu ##ss ##les that go on in the premier league depending on whether you ' re at the top , in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting . "
due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other premier league clubs . [SEP] the years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the " big four " with tottenham hotspur and manchester city both breaking into the top four . in the 2009 – 10 season , tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since everton in 2005 . criticism of the gap between an elite group of " super clubs " and the majority of the premier league has continued , nevertheless , due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other premier league clubs . manchester city won the title in the 2011 – 12 season , becoming the first club outside the " big four " to win since 1994 – 95 . that season also saw two of the big four ( chelsea and liverpool ) finish outside the top four places for the first time since 1994 – 95 .
john qui ##nton and peter leave ##r , were forced to resign in march 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former sky executives sam chi ##sho ##lm and david chance . [SEP] the football association premier league ltd ( fa ##pl ) is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs . each club is a shareholder , with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts . the clubs elect a chairman , chief executive , and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league . the current chairman is sir dave richards , who was appointed in april 1999 , and the chief executive is richard sc ##uda ##more , appointed in november 1999 . the former chairman and chief executive , john qui ##nton and peter leave ##r , were forced to resign in march 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former sky executives sam chi ##sho ##lm and david chance . the football association is not directly involved in the day - to - day operations of the premier league , but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league .
will automatically qualify for the uefa europa league first qualifying round [SEP] the team placed fifth in the premier league automatically qu ##ali ##fies for the uefa europa league , and the sixth and seventh - placed teams can also qualify , depending on the winners of the two domestic cup competitions i . e . the fa cup and the capital one cup ( league cup ) . two europa league places are reserved for the winners of each tournament ; if the winner of either the fa cup or league cup qu ##ali ##fies for the champions league , then that place will go to the next - best placed finish ##er in the premier league . a further place in the uefa europa league is also available via the fair play initiative . if the premier league has one of the three highest fair play rankings in europe , the highest ranked team in the premier league fair play standings which has not already qualified for europe will automatically qualify for the uefa europa league first qualifying round .
for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to english football and the united kingdom ' s broadcasting industry . [SEP] the premier league has the highest revenue of any football league in the world , with total club revenues of € ##2 . 48 billion in 2009 – 10 . in 2013 – 14 , due to improved television revenues and cost controls , the premier league had net profits in excess of £ ##7 ##8 million , exceeding all other football leagues . in 2010 the premier league was awarded the queen ' s award for enterprise in the international trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to english football and the united kingdom ' s broadcasting industry .
pay television was an almost un ##test ##ed proposition in the uk market , [SEP] television has played a major role in the history of the premier league . the league ' s decision to assign broadcasting rights to bs ##ky ##b in 1992 was at the time a radical decision , but one that has paid off . at the time pay television was an almost un ##test ##ed proposition in the uk market , as was charging fans to watch live televised football . however , a combination of sky ' s strategy , the quality of premier league football and the public ' s appetite for the game has seen the value of the premier league ' s tv rights so ##ar .

a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs [SEP] the premier league sells its television rights on a collective basis . this is in contrast to some other european leagues , including la liga , in which each club sells its rights individually , leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs . the money is divided into three parts : half is divided equally between the clubs ; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position , the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club , and equal steps all the way down the table ; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television , with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this . the income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs .
sky ' s monopoly was broken from august 2006 when set ##anta sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available . [SEP] the first sky television rights agreement was worth £3 ##0 ##4 million over five seasons . the next contract , negotiated to start from the 1997 – 98 season , rose to £ ##6 ##70 million over four seasons . the third contract was a £1 . 02 ##4 billion deal with bs ##ky ##b for the three seasons from 2001 – 02 to 2003 – 04 . the league brought in £3 ##20 million from the sale of its international rights for the three - year period from 2004 – 05 to 2006 – 07 . it sold the rights itself on a territory - by - territory basis . sky ' s monopoly was broken from august 2006 when set ##anta sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available . this occurred following an insistence by the european commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company . sky and set ##anta paid a total of £1 . 7 billion , a two - thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had level ##led off following many years of rapid growth . set ##anta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for irish viewers . the bbc has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons ( on match of the day ) for £1 ##7 ##1 . 6 million , a 63 per cent increase on the £10 ##5 million it paid for the previous three - year period . sky and bt have agreed to jointly pay £ ##8 ##4 . 3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games ( that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet ) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on match ##day . overseas television rights fetch ##ed £ ##6 ##25 million , nearly double the previous contract . the total raised from these deals is more than £2 . 7 billion , giving premier league clubs an average media income from league games of around £ ##40 million - a - year from 2007 to 2010 .
this occurred following an insistence by the european commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company . [SEP] the first sky television rights agreement was worth £3 ##0 ##4 million over five seasons . the next contract , negotiated to start from the 1997 – 98 season , rose to £ ##6 ##70 million over four seasons . the third contract was a £1 . 02 ##4 billion deal with bs ##ky ##b for the three seasons from 2001 – 02 to 2003 – 04 . the league brought in £3 ##20 million from the sale of its international rights for the three - year period from 2004 – 05 to 2006 – 07 . it sold the rights itself on a territory - by - territory basis . sky ' s monopoly was broken from august 2006 when set ##anta sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available . this occurred following an insistence by the european commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company . sky and set ##anta paid a total of £1 . 7 billion , a two - thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had level ##led off following many years of rapid growth . set ##anta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for irish viewers . the bbc has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons ( on match of the day ) for £1 ##7 ##1 . 6 million , a 63 per cent increase on the £10 ##5 million it paid for the previous three - year period . sky and bt have agreed to jointly pay £ ##8 ##4 . 3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games ( that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet ) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on match ##day . overseas television rights fetch ##ed £ ##6 ##25 million , nearly double the previous contract . the total raised from these deals is more than £2 . 7 billion , giving premier league clubs an average media income from league games of around £ ##40 million - a - year from 2007 to 2010 .
the tv rights agreement between the premier league and sky has faced accusations of being a cartel [SEP] the tv rights agreement between the premier league and sky has faced accusations of being a cartel , and a number of court cases have arise ##n as a result . an investigation by the office of fair trading in 2002 found bs ##ky ##b to be dominant within the pay tv sports market , but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that bs ##ky ##b had abused its dominant position . in july 1999 the premier league ' s method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the uk restrictive practices court , who concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest .
in large part to the di ##spar ##ity in revenue from television rights between the leagues , [SEP] there has been an increasing gulf between the premier league and the football league . since its split with the football league , many established clubs in the premier league have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues . owing in large part to the di ##spar ##ity in revenue from television rights between the leagues , many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the premier league . in every season except 2001 – 02 and 2011 – 12 , at least one premier league newcomer has been relegated back to the football league . in 1997 – 98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season .
in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young english players in favour of foreign players [SEP] in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young english players in favour of foreign players , in 1999 , the home office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the european union . a non - eu player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive ' a ' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years , and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official fifa world rankings over the previous two years . if a player does not meet those criteria , the club wishing to sign him may appeal .
this was to enable the ' home grown ' rule to be enacted , [SEP] players may only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the football association . the two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 august and from 31 december to 31 january . player registration ##s cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the fa , usually on an emergency basis . as of the 2010 – 11 season , the premier league introduced new rules man ##dating that each club must register a maximum 25 - man squad of players aged over 21 , with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances . this was to enable the ' home grown ' rule to be enacted , whereby the league would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of ' home - grown players ' .
alliance - seeking [SEP] in contrast , roman expansion into spain and gaul occurred as a mix of alliance - seeking and military occupation . in the 2nd century bc , roman involvement in the greek east remained a matter of alliance - seeking , but this time in the face of major powers that could rival rome . according to poly ##bius , who sought to trace how rome came to dominate the greek east in less than a century , this was mainly a matter of several greek city - states seeking roman protection against the macedonian kingdom and se ##le ##uc ##id empire in the face of des ##ta ##bilis ##ation created by the weakening of pt ##ole ##ma ##ic egypt . in contrast to the west , the greek east had been dominated by major empires for centuries , and roman influence and alliance - seeking led to wars with these empires that further weakened them and therefore created an unstable power vacuum that only rome could fill . this had some important similarities to ( and important differences from ) the events in italy centuries earlier , but this time on a global scale .
revolt of several of their latin allies [SEP] after recovering surprisingly fast from the sack of rome , the romans immediately resumed their expansion within italy . the first sam ##ni ##te war from 343 bc to 341 bc was relatively short : the romans beat the sam ##ni ##tes in two battles , but were forced to withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their latin allies in the latin war . rome beat the latin ##s in the battle of ve ##su ##vius and again in the battle of tri ##fan ##um , after which the latin cities were obliged to submit to roman rule .
to threaten the cart ##ha ##gin ##ian capital [SEP] the romans held off hannibal in three battles , but then hannibal smashed a succession of roman consular armies . by this time hannibal ' s brother has ##dr ##uba ##l bar ##ca sought to cross the alps into italy and join his brother with a second army . has ##dr ##uba ##l managed to break through into italy only to be defeated decisive ##ly on the meta ##urus river . unable to defeat hannibal on italian soil , the romans bold ##ly sent an army to africa under sci ##pio african ##us to threaten the cart ##ha ##gin ##ian capital . hannibal was recalled to africa , and defeated at the battle of za ##ma .
in case the se ##le ##uc ##ids ever got to italy [SEP] fearing the worst , the romans began a major mobilization , all but pulling out of recently pac ##ified spain and gaul . they even established a major garrison in sicily in case the se ##le ##uc ##ids ever got to italy . this fear was shared by rome ' s greek allies , who had largely ignored rome in the years after the second macedonian war , but now followed rome again for the first time since that war . a major roman - greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the second pun ##ic war , sci ##pio african ##us , and set out for greece , beginning the roman - syrian war . after initial fighting that revealed serious se ##le ##uc ##id weaknesses , the se ##le ##uc ##ids tried to turn the roman strength against them at the battle of the ##rm ##op ##yla ##e ( as they believed the 300 spartans had done centuries earlier ) . like the spartans , the se ##le ##uc ##ids lost the battle , and were forced to evacuate greece . the romans pursued the se ##le ##uc ##ids by crossing the hell ##es ##pon ##t , which marked the first time a roman army had ever entered asia . the decisive engagement was fought at the battle of mag ##nesia , resulting in a complete roman victory . the se ##le ##uc ##ids sued for peace , and rome forced them to give up their recent greek conquest ##s . although they still controlled a great deal of territory , this defeat marked the decline of their empire , as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east ( the part ##hian ##s ) and the west ( the greeks ) . their empire di ##sin ##te ##grate ##d into a rum ##p over the course of the next century , when it was eclipse ##d by pont ##us . following mag ##nesia , rome again withdrew from greece , assuming ( or hoping ) that the lack of a major greek power would ensure a stable peace . in fact , it did the opposite .

would give him the dramatic military success he sought [SEP] during his term as pr ##ae ##tor in the iberian peninsula ( modern portugal and spain ) , po ##mp ##ey ' s contemporary julius caesar defeated two local tribes in battle . after his term as consul in 59 bc , he was appointed to a five - year term as the pro ##con ##sul ##ar governor of cis ##al ##pine gaul ( part of current northern italy ) , trans ##al ##pine gaul ( current southern france ) and ill ##yria ( part of the modern balkans ) . not content with an idle governors ##hip , caesar st ##rove to find reason to invade gaul ( modern france and belgium ) , which would give him the dramatic military success he sought . when two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near ( not into ) the roman province of trans ##al ##pine gaul , caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his gall ##ic wars , fought between 58 bc and 49 bc .
the roman republic was in danger [SEP] caesar was now the primary figure of the roman state , enforcing and en ##tre ##nch ##ing his powers . his enemies feared that he had ambitions to become an auto ##cratic ruler . arguing that the roman republic was in danger , a group of senators hatch ##ed a conspiracy and assassinated caesar at a meeting of the senate in march 44 bc . mark antony , caesar ' s lieutenant , condemned caesar ' s assassination , and war broke out between the two factions . antony was denounced as a public enemy , and caesar ' s adopted son and chosen heir , gaius oct ##avian ##us , was entrusted with the command of the war against him . at the battle of mu ##tina mark antony was defeated by the consul ##s hi ##rti ##us and pan ##sa , who were both killed .
because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy [SEP] the ho ##rte ##ns ##ian law deprived the patricia ##ns of their last weapon against the pl ##eb ##eia ##ns , and thus resolved the last great political question of the era . no such important political changes occurred between 287 bc and 133 bc . the important laws of this era were still enacted by the senate . in effect , the pl ##eb ##eia ##ns were satisfied with the possession of power , but did not care to use it . the senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy . this was the most mil ##ita ##rily active era of the roman republic .
commodity prices fell [SEP] in the final decades of this era many pl ##eb ##eia ##ns grew poorer . the long military campaigns had forced citizens to leave their farms to fight , while their farms fell into disrepair . the landed aristocracy began buying bankrupt ##ed farms at discount ##ed prices . as commodity prices fell , many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit . the result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers . masses of unemployed pl ##eb ##eia ##ns soon began to flood into rome , and thus into the ranks of the legislative assemblies . their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most . a new culture of dependency was emerging , in which citizens would look to any pop ##uli ##st leader for relief .
marius and lucius cornelius ci ##nna soon took control of the city [SEP] several years later , in 88 bc , a roman army was sent to put down an emerging asian power , king mit ##hri ##dates of pont ##us . the army , however , was defeated . one of marius ' old qu ##ae ##stor ##s , lucius cornelius sul ##la , had been elected consul for the year , and was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against mit ##hri ##dates . marius , a member of the " popular ##es " party , had a tribune rev ##oke sul ##la ' s command of the war against mit ##hri ##dates . sul ##la , a member of the aristocratic ( " opt ##imate ##s " ) party , brought his army back to italy and marched on rome . sul ##la was so angry at marius ' tribune that he passed a law intended to permanently weaken the tri ##bu ##nate . he then returned to his war against mit ##hri ##dates . with sul ##la gone , the popular ##es under marius and lucius cornelius ci ##nna soon took control of the city .
childbirth [SEP] cl ##od ##ius formed armed gangs that terror ##ised the city and eventually began to attack po ##mp ##ey ' s followers , who in response funded counter - gangs formed by titus ann ##ius milo . the political alliance of the tri ##um ##vira ##te was crumbling . dom ##iti ##us ah ##eno ##bar ##bus ran for the consul ##ship in 55 bc promising to take caesar ' s command from him . eventually , the tri ##um ##vira ##te was renewed at luc ##ca . po ##mp ##ey and cr ##ass ##us were promised the consul ##ship in 55 bc , and caesar ' s term as governor was extended for five years . cr ##ass ##us led an ill - fated expedition with legions led by his son , caesar ' s lieutenant , against the kingdom of part ##hia . this resulted in his defeat and death at the battle of carr ##hae . finally , po ##mp ##ey ' s wife , julia , who was caesar ' s daughter , died in childbirth . this event severed the last remaining bond between po ##mp ##ey and caesar .
fear of retaliation [SEP] caesar was assassinated on march 15 , 44 bc . the assassination was led by gaius cass ##ius and marcus br ##utus . most of the con ##sp ##ira ##tors were senators , who had a variety of economic , political , or personal motivation ##s for carrying out the assassination . many were afraid that caesar would soon res ##ur ##re ##ct the monarchy and declare himself king . others feared loss of property or prestige as caesar carried out his land reforms in favor of the land ##less classes . virtually all the con ##sp ##ira ##tors fled the city after caesar ' s death in fear of retaliation . the civil war that followed destroyed what was left of the republic .
greater collapse of the middle classes [SEP] the extraordinary demands of the pun ##ic wars , in addition to a shortage of manpower , exposed the tactical weaknesses of the mani ##pu ##lar legion , at least in the short term . in 217 bc , near the beginning of the second pun ##ic war , rome was forced to effectively ignore its long - standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners . during the 2nd century bc , roman territory saw an overall decline in population , partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars . this was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes . as a result , the roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state , which it had not had to do in the past .
constitutional government would be dissolved [SEP] since the tribune ##s were considered to be the em ##bo ##diment of the pl ##eb ##eia ##ns , they were sac ##ros ##an ##ct . their sac ##ros ##an ##ct ##ity was enforced by a pledge , taken by the pl ##eb ##eia ##ns , to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office . all of the powers of the tribune derived from their sac ##ros ##an ##ct ##ity . one consequence was that it was considered a capital offense to harm a tribune , to disregard his veto , or to interfere with a tribune . in times of military emergency , a dictator would be appointed for a term of six months . constitutional government would be dissolved , and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state . when the dictator ' s term ended , constitutional government would be restored .
various military conquest ##s in the greek east [SEP] following various military conquest ##s in the greek east , romans adapted a number of greek educational pre ##ce ##pts to their own fledgling system . they began physical training to prepare the boys to grow as roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army . conform ##ing to discipline was a point of great emphasis . girls generally received instruction from their mothers in the art of spinning , weaving , and sewing . schooling in a more formal sense was begun around 200 bc . education began at the age of around six , and in the next six to seven years , boys and girls were expected to learn the basics of reading , writing and counting . by the age of twelve , they would be learning latin , greek , grammar and literature , followed by training for public speaking . or ##atory was an art to be practiced and learnt , and good or ##ators commanded respect .

low military - industrial capacity [SEP] the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the japanese at battle of sui ##xia ##n - za ##oya ##ng and 1st battle of chang ##sha . after these victories , chinese nationalist forces launched a large - scale counter - offensive in early 1940 ; however , due to its low military - industrial capacity , it was repulsed by japanese army in late march 1940 . in august of 1940 , chinese communists launched an offensive in central china ; in retaliation , japan instituted the " three all ##s policy " ( " kill all , burn all , lo ##ot all " ) in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists . by 1941 the conflict had become a stale ##mate . although japan had occupied much of northern , central , and coastal china , the nationalist government had retreated to the interior with a provisional capital set up at chung ##king while the chinese communists remained in control of base areas in sha ##an ##xi . in addition , japanese control of northern and central china was somewhat ten ##uous , in that japan was usually able to control railroads and the major cities ( " points and lines " ) , but did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast chinese countryside . the japanese found its aggression against the retreating and reg ##roup ##ing chinese army was stalled by the mountainous terrain in southwestern china while the communists organised widespread guerrilla and sa ##bot ##eur activities in northern and eastern china behind the japanese front line .
oil reserves [SEP] from as early as 1935 japanese military st ##rate ##gist ##s had concluded the dutch east indies were , because of their oil reserves , of considerable importance to japan . by 1940 they had expanded this to include indo - china , malaya , and the philippines within their concept of the greater east asia co - prosperity sphere . japanese troop build ups in hai ##nan , taiwan , and hai ##phon ##g were noted , japanese army officers were openly talking about an inevitable war , and admiral sank ##ichi takahashi was reported as saying a showdown with the united states was necessary .
denying it the raw materials needed to continue its activities [SEP] in an effort to discourage japanese mil ##ita ##ris ##m , western powers including australia , the united states , britain , and the dutch government in exile , which controlled the petroleum - rich dutch east indies , stopped selling oil , iron ore , and steel to japan , denying it the raw materials needed to continue its activities in china and french indochina . in japan , the government and nationalists viewed these em ##bar ##gos as acts of aggression ; imported oil made up about 80 % of domestic consumption , without which japan ' s economy , let alone its military , would grind to a halt . the japanese media , influenced by military prop ##aga ##ndi ##sts , [ n ##b 10 ] began to refer to the em ##bar ##go ##es as the " abc ##d ( " american - british - chinese - dutch " ) en ##ci ##rcle ##ment " or " abc ##d line " .

allow japan free rein in asia [SEP] in the early hours of 7 december ( hawaiian time ) , japan launched a major surprise carrier - based air strike on pearl harbor without explicit warning , which crippled the u . s . pacific fleet , leaving eight american battleships out of action , 188 american aircraft destroyed , and 2 , 403 american citizens dead . at the time of the attack , the u . s . was not officially at war anywhere in the world , which means that the people killed or property destroyed at pearl harbor by the japanese attack had a non - combat ##ant status . [ n ##b 11 ] the japanese had gamble ##d that the united states , when faced with such a sudden and massive blow , would agree to a negotiated settlement and allow japan free rein in asia . this gamble did not pay off . american losses were less serious than initially thought : the american aircraft carriers , which would prove to be more important than battleships , were at sea , and vital naval infrastructure ( fuel oil tanks , shipyard facilities , and a power station ) , submarine base , and signals intelligence units were un ##sca ##thed . japan ' s fall ##back strategy , relying on a war of at ##tri ##tion to make the u . s . come to terms , was beyond the i ##jn ' s capabilities .
virtually stranded [SEP] u . s . submarines , as well as some british and dutch vessels , operating from bases at ca ##vite in the philippines ( 1941 – 42 ) ; fremantle and brisbane , australia ; pearl harbor ; tri ##nco ##mal ##ee , ceylon ; midway ; and later guam , played a major role in defeating japan , even though submarines made up a small proportion of the allied na ##vies — less than two percent in the case of the us navy . submarines strangled japan by sinking its merchant fleet , intercept ##ing many troop transports , and cutting off nearly all the oil imports essential to weapons production and military operations . by early 1945 japanese oil supplies were so limited that its fleet was virtually stranded .
starved [SEP] as many japanese had feared , japan ' s supply arrangements could not maintain her forces . once mu ##tag ##uchi ' s hopes for an early victory were thwarted , his troops , particularly those at ko ##hima , starved . during may , while mu ##tag ##uchi continued to order attacks , the allies advanced southward ##s from ko ##hima and northwards from imp ##hal . the two allied attacks met on 22 june , breaking the japanese siege of imp ##hal . the japanese finally broke off the operation on 3 july . they had lost over 50 , 000 troops , mainly to starvation and disease . this represented the worst defeat suffered by the japanese army to that date .

its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents [SEP] in 1821 , mexico won its independence from spain , and san diego became part of the mexican territory of alta california . in 1822 , mexico began attempting to extend its authority over the coastal territory of alta california . the fort on pre ##si ##dio hill was gradually abandoned , while the town of san diego grew up on the level land below pre ##si ##dio hill . the mission was secular ##ized by the mexican government in 1833 , and most of the mission lands were sold to wealthy cal ##if ##orn ##io settlers . the 43 ##2 residents of the town petitioned the governor to form a pueblo , and juan maria os ##una was elected the first al ##cal ##de ( " municipal magistrate " ) , defeating pi ##o pic ##o in the vote . ( see , list of pre - statehood mayors of san diego . ) however , san diego had been losing population throughout the 1830s and in 1838 the town lost its pueblo status because its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents . beyond town mexican land grants expanded the number of california rancho ##s that modest ##ly added to the local economy .

to include the entire bay within the united states [SEP] stockton and ke ##ar ##ny went on to recover los angeles and force the cap ##it ##ulation of alta california with the " treaty of ca ##hue ##nga " on january 13 , 1847 . as a result of the mexican – american war of 1846 – 48 , the territory of alta california , including san diego , was ceded to the united states by mexico , under the terms of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo in 1848 . the mexican ne ##go ##tia ##tors of that treaty tried to retain san diego as part of mexico , but the americans insisted that san diego was " for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of san francisco , " and the mexican - american border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of san diego bay , so as to include the entire bay within the united states .
the city was bankrupt [SEP] the state of california was admitted to the united states in 1850 . that same year san diego was designated the seat of the newly established san diego county and was incorporated as a city . joshua h . bean , the last al ##cal ##de of san diego , was elected the first mayor . two years later the city was bankrupt ; the california legislature revoked the city ' s charter and placed it under control of a board of trustees , where it remained until 1889 . a city charter was re - established in 1889 and today ' s city charter was adopted in 1931 .
the arrival of a railroad connection [SEP] the original town of san diego was located at the foot of pre ##si ##dio hill , in the area which is now old town san diego state historic park . the location was not ideal , being several miles away from navigable water . in 1850 , william heath davis promoted a new development by the bay shore called " new san diego " , several miles south of the original settlement ; however , for several decades the new development consisted only a few houses , a pier and an army depot . in the late 1860s , al ##onzo horton promoted a move to the bays ##ide area , which he called " new town " and which became downtown san diego . horton promoted the area heavily , and people and businesses began to relocate to new town because of its location on san diego bay convenient to shipping . new town soon eclipse ##d the original settlement , known to this day as old town , and became the economic and governmental heart of the city . still , san diego remained a relative back ##water town until the arrival of a railroad connection in 1878 .
most were eventually rebuilt , using casting ##s of the original facades to retain the architectural style . [SEP] in the early part of the 20th century , san diego hosted two world ' s fairs : the panama - california exposition in 1915 and the california pacific international exposition in 1935 . both exposition ##s were held in bal ##bo ##a park , and many of the spanish / baroque - style buildings that were built for those exposition ##s remain to this day as central features of the park . the buildings were intended to be temporary structures , but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair . most were eventually rebuilt , using casting ##s of the original facades to retain the architectural style . the men ##ager ##ie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the san diego zoo . during the 1950s there was a city ##wide festival called fiesta del pacific ##o highlighting the area ' s spanish and mexican past . in the 2010s there was a proposal for a large - scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of bal ##bo ##a park , but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with putting on the celebration went out of business .
rising costs and foreign competition [SEP] from the start of the 20th century through the 1970s , the american tuna fishing fleet and tuna canning industry were based in san diego , " the tuna capital of the world " . san diego ' s first tuna can ##nery was founded in 1911 , and by the mid - 1930s the can ##ner ##ies employed more than 1 , 000 people . a large fishing fleet supported the can ##ner ##ies , mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen from japan , and later from the portuguese azores and italy whose influence is still felt in neighborhoods like little italy and point lo ##ma . due to rising costs and foreign competition , the last of the can ##ner ##ies closed in the early 1980s .
poor air quality [SEP] san diego and its back ##co ##unt ##ry are subject to periodic wild ##fires . in october 2003 , san diego was the site of the cedar fire , which has been called the largest wild ##fire in california over the past century . the fire burned 280 , 000 acres ( 1 , 100 km ##2 ) , killed 15 people , and destroyed more than 2 , 200 homes . in addition to damage caused by the fire , smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits due to asthma , respiratory problems , eye irritation , and smoke in ##hala ##tion ; the poor air quality caused san diego county schools to close for a week . wild ##fires four years later destroyed some areas , particularly within the communities of rancho bernardo , rancho santa fe , and ramon ##a .
for collaboration potentially between wireless and life sciences [SEP] san diego hosts several major producers of wireless cellular technology . qu ##al ##com ##m was founded and is headquartered in san diego , and is one of the largest private - sector employers in san diego . other wireless industry manufacturers headquartered here include nokia , l ##g electronics , ky ##oc ##era international . , cricket communications and nova ##tel wireless . the largest software company in san diego is security software company web ##sen ##se inc . san diego also has the u . s . headquarters for the slovakia ##n security company es ##et . san diego has been designated as an i ##hu ##b innovation center for collaboration potentially between wireless and life sciences .
allegations of repeated sexual harassment [SEP] in july 2013 , three former supporters of mayor bob fi ##ln ##er asked him to resign because of allegations of repeated sexual harassment . over the ensuing six weeks , 18 women came forward to publicly claim that fi ##ln ##er had sexually harassed them , and multiple individuals and groups called for him to resign . on august 19 fi ##ln ##er and city representatives entered a mediation process , as a result of which fi ##ln ##er agreed to resign , effective august 30 , 2013 , while the city agreed to limit his legal and financial exposure . fi ##ln ##er subsequently pleaded guilty to one felony count of false imprisonment and two mis ##de ##me ##anor battery charges , and was sentenced to house arrest and probation .

because of its relative proximity to the larger city [SEP] san diego ' s first television station was k ##fm ##b , which began broadcasting on may 16 , 1949 . since the federal communications commission ( fcc ) licensed seven television stations in los angeles , two vhf channels were available for san diego because of its relative proximity to the larger city . in 1952 , however , the fcc began licensing uhf channels , making it possible for cities such as san diego to acquire more stations . stations based in mexico ( with it ##u prefix ##es of x ##e and x ##h ) also serve the san diego market . television stations today include x ##ht ##j ##b 3 ( once tv ) , x ##et ##v 6 ( cw ) , k ##fm ##b 8 ( cbs ) , kg ##tv 10 ( abc ) , x ##ew ##t 12 ( tel ##ev ##isa regional ) , k ##p ##bs 15 ( pbs ) , kb ##nt - cd 17 ( un ##ivision ) , x ##ht ##it - td ##t 21 ( aztec ##a 7 ) , x ##h ##jk - td ##t 27 ( aztec ##a 13 ) , x ##has 33 ( tel ##em ##und ##o ) , k ##35 ##d ##g - d 35 ( uc ##sd - tv ) , k ##dt ##f - ld 51 ( tel ##ef ##ut ##ura ) , kn ##sd 39 ( nbc ) , k ##z ##sd - lp 41 ( aztec ##a america ) , ks ##ex - cd 42 ( info ##mer ##cial ##s ) , x ##h ##b ##j - td ##t 45 ( gala tv ) , x ##hd ##tv 49 ( mn ##tv ) , ku ##si 51 ( independent ) , x ##hua ##a - td ##t 57 ( canal de las est ##rella ##s ) , and ks ##w ##b - tv 69 ( fox ) . san diego has an 80 . 6 percent cable penetration rate .
the grid street patterns [SEP] san diego ' s roadway system provides an extensive network of routes for travel by bicycle . the dry and mild climate of san diego makes cycling a convenient and pleasant year - round option . at the same time , the city ' s hilly , canyon - like terrain and significantly long average trip distances — brought about by strict low - density zoning laws — somewhat restrict cycling for ut ##ili ##tarian purposes . older and dense ##r neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be utility cycling oriented . this is partly because of the grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core , where suburban style arterial roads are much more common . as a result , a vast majority of cycling - related activities are recreational . testament to san diego ' s cycling efforts , in 2006 , san diego was rated as the best city for cycling for u . s . cities with a population over 1 million .

such artistic depictions may lead to idol ##at ##ry [SEP] no islamic visual images or depictions of god are meant to exist because it is believed that such artistic depictions may lead to idol ##at ##ry . moreover , muslims believe that god is inc ##or ##pore ##al , making any two - or three - dimensional depictions impossible . instead , muslims describe god by the names and attributes that , according to islam , he revealed to his creation . all but one sur ##a of the quran begins with the phrase " in the name of god , the ben ##ef ##ice ##nt , the mer ##ciful " . images of mohammed are likewise prohibited . such an ##icon ##ism and icon ##oc ##las ##m can also be found in jewish and some christian theology .
women to reveal too much in order to be deemed attractive [SEP] in a small minority of muslim countries , the law requires women to cover either just legs , shoulders and head or the whole body apart from the face . in strict ##est forms , the face as well must be covered leaving just a mesh to see through . these rules for dressing cause tensions , concerning particularly muslims living in western countries , where restrictions are considered both sex ##ist and oppressive . some muslims oppose this charge , and instead declare that the media in these countries presses on women to reveal too much in order to be deemed attractive , and that this is itself sex ##ist and oppressive .
the iran crisis of 1946 [SEP] in 1941 , reza shah was forced to abd ##icate in favor of his son , mohammad reza pa ##hl ##avi , and established the persian corridor , a massive supply route that would last until the end of the ongoing war . the presence of so many foreign troops in the nation also culminated in the soviet - backed establishment of two puppet regimes in the nation ; the azerbaijan people ' s government , and the republic of maha ##bad . as the soviet union refused to re ##lin ##qui ##sh the occupied iranian territory , the iran crisis of 1946 was followed , which particularly resulted in the dissolution of both puppet states , and the withdrawal of the soviets .
economy of iran was flooded with foreign currency [SEP] due to the 1973 spike in oil prices , the economy of iran was flooded with foreign currency , which caused inflation . by 1974 , the economy of iran was experiencing double digit inflation , and despite many large projects to modern ##ize the country , corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste . by 1975 and 1976 , an economic recession led to increased unemployment , especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s . by the late 1970s , many of these people opposed the shah ' s regime and began to organize and join the protests against it .

were executed [SEP] the immediate nationwide uprising ##s against the new government began by the 1979 kurdish rebellion with the k ##hu ##zes ##tan uprising ##s , along with the uprising ##s in sis ##tan and bal ##uche ##stan province and other areas . over the next several years , these uprising ##s were subdued in a violent manner by the new islamic government . the new government went about pu ##rg ##ing itself of the non - islamist political opposition . although both nationalists and marxist ##s had initially joined with islamist ##s to overthrow the shah , tens of thousands were executed by the islamic government afterward .
foreign em ##bar ##go ##es [SEP] since the 1979 revolution , to overcome foreign em ##bar ##go ##es , iran has developed its own military industry , produced its own tanks , armored personnel carriers , guided missiles , submarines , military vessels , guided missile destroyer , radar systems , helicopters and fighter planes . in recent years , official announcements have highlighted the development of weapons such as the ho ##ot , ko ##ws ##ar , ze ##lz ##al , fate ##h - 110 , shah ##ab - 3 and se ##j ##ji ##l missiles , and a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles ( ua ##vs ) . the fa ##j ##r - 3 ( mir ##v ) is currently iran ' s most advanced ballistic missile , it is a liquid fuel missile with an undisclosed range which was developed and produced domestically .
its variety of ethnic groups [SEP] iranian cuisine is diverse due to its variety of ethnic groups and the influence of other cultures . herbs are frequently used along with fruits such as plum ##s , po ##me ##gra ##nate ##s , qui ##nce , pr ##unes , apr ##ico ##ts , and rai ##sin ##s . iranian ##s usually eat plain yo ##gur ##t with lunch and dinner ; it is a staple of the diet in iran . to achieve a balanced taste , characteristic flavour ##ings such as sa ##ff ##ron , dried lime ##s , cinnamon , and par ##sley are mixed delicately and used in some special dishes . onions and garlic are normally used in the preparation of the accompanying course , but are also served separately during meals , either in raw or pick ##led form . iran is also famous for its ca ##via ##r .
association of the word british [SEP] the term british isles is controversial in ireland , where there are objections to its usage due to the association of the word british with ireland . the government of ireland does not recognise or use the term and its embassy in london discourage ##s its use . as a result , britain and ireland is used as an alternative description , and atlantic archipelago has had limited use among a minority in academia , although british isles is still commonly employed . within them , they are also sometimes referred to as these islands .
cr ##aton baltic ##a collided with the terra ##ne avalon ##ia [SEP] the british isles lie at the jun ##cture of several regions with past episodes of te ##cton ##ic mountain building . these oro ##genic belts form a complex geology that records a huge and varied span of earth ' s history . of particular note was the caledonian oro ##geny during the or ##do ##vic ##ian period , c . 48 ##8 – 44 ##4 ma and early si ##lu ##rian period , when the cr ##aton baltic ##a collided with the terra ##ne avalon ##ia to form the mountains and hills in northern britain and ireland . baltic ##a formed roughly the northwestern half of ireland and scotland . further collisions caused the var ##is ##can oro ##geny in the devon ##ian and carbon ##iferous periods , forming the hills of munster , southwest england , and southern wales . over the last 500 million years the land that forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30 ##° ##s , crossing the equator around 370 million years ago to reach its present northern latitude .
the english channel flooded [SEP] the islands have been shaped by numerous g ##la ##ciation ##s during the qu ##ater ##nary period , the most recent being the dev ##ens ##ian . [ citation needed ] as this ended , the central irish sea was de ##gl ##ac ##iated and the english channel flooded , with sea levels rising to current levels some 4 , 000 to 5 , 000 years ago , leaving the british isles in their current form . whether or not there was a land bridge between great britain and ireland at this time is somewhat disputed , though there was certainly a single ice sheet covering the entire sea .
due to a small population [SEP] as with most of europe , prehistoric britain and ireland were covered with forest and swamp . clearing began around 6000 bc and accelerated in medieval times . despite this , britain retained its prime ##val forests longer than most of europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry , and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century . by the 18th century , most of britain ' s forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from scandinavia , north america , and the baltic . most forest land in ireland is maintained by state forest ##ation programmes . almost all land outside urban areas is farmland . however , relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north scotland and in southeast england . oak , elm , ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in england . in scotland , pine and birch are most common . natural forests in ireland are mainly oak , ash , w ##ych elm , birch and pine . beech and lime , though not native to ireland , are also common there . farmland hosts a variety of semi - natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants . woods , hedge ##row ##s , mountain slopes and marshes host heather , wild grasses , go ##rse and bra ##cken .
sea levels rose [SEP] at the end of the last ice age , what are now the british isles were joined to the european mainland as a mass of land extending north west from the modern - day northern coastline of france , belgium and the netherlands . ice covered almost all of what is now scotland , most of ireland and wales , and the hills of northern england . from 14 , 000 to 10 , 000 years ago , as the ice melted , sea levels rose separating ireland from great britain and also creating the isle of man . about two to four millennia later , great britain became separated from the mainland . britain probably became rep ##op ##ulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland . it is likely that ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island .
the dark ages [SEP] anglo - saxons arrived as roman power wan ##ed in the 5th century ad . initially , their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the brit ##ons as mercenaries to rep ##uls ##e inc ##urs ##ions by the hi ##ber ##ni and pic ##ts . in time , anglo - saxon demands on the british became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern great britain , though recent genetic evidence suggests brit ##ons still formed the bulk of the population . this dominance creating what is now england and leaving culturally british enclave ##s only in the north of what is now england , in cornwall and what is now known as wales . ireland had been unaffected by the romans except , significantly , having been christian ##ised , traditionally by the romano - brit ##on , saint patrick . as europe , including britain , descended into turmoil following the collapse of roman civil ##isation , an era known as the dark ages , ireland entered a golden age and responded with missions ( first to great britain and then to the continent ) , the founding of monasteries and universities . these were later joined by anglo - saxon missions of a similar nature .
political up ##hea ##val , religious division and war [SEP] scotland , meanwhile had remained an independent kingdom . in 1603 , that changed when the king of scotland inherited the crown of england , and consequently the crown of ireland also . the subsequent 17th century was one of political up ##hea ##val , religious division and war . english colonial ##ism in ireland of the 16th century was extended by large - scale scottish and english colonies in ulster . religious division heightened and the king in england came into conflict with parliament . a prime issue was , inter ali ##a , over his policy of tolerance towards catholicism . the resulting english civil war or war of the three kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in england . ireland , largely catholic was mainly loyal to the king . following defeat to the parliament ##s army , large scale land distributions from loyalist irish nobility to english common ##ers in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new as ##cend ##ancy class which over the next hundred years would ob ##lite ##rate the english ( hi ##ber ##no - norman ) and gaelic irish nobility in ireland . the new ruling class was protestant and british , whilst the common people were largely catholic and irish . this theme would influence irish politics for centuries to come . when the monarchy was restored in england , the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land - owners in ireland . the " glorious revolution " of 1688 repeated similar themes : a catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a protestant parliament in england . the king ' s army was defeated at the battle of the boy ##ne and at the mil ##ita ##rily crucial battle of aug ##hri ##m in ireland . resistance held out , and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the treaty of limerick . however , in the evolving political climate , the terms of limerick were superseded , a new monarchy was installed , and the new irish parliament was packed with the new elite which leg ##is ##lated increasing into ##ler ##ant penal laws , which disco ##mm ##ode ##d both dissent ##ers and catholics .

a draw [SEP] association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the laws of the game . the game is played using a spherical ball of 68 . 5 – 69 . 5 cm ( 27 . 0 – 27 . 4 in ) ci ##rc ##um ##ference , known as the football ( or soccer ball ) . two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team ' s goal ( between the posts and under the bar ) , thereby scoring a goal . the team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner ; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw . each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the laws of the game : to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick - off or penalty kicks .
relegated to a lower division [SEP] the governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season , normally comprising several divisions , in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results . teams are placed into tables , placing them in order according to points acc ##rued . most commonly , each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season , in a round - robin tournament . at the end of a season , the top team is declared the champion . the top few teams may be promoted to a higher division , and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division .
inhabitants moved to the wet ##ter coast [SEP] this influx was compound ##ed by the decline of the western sudan ##ic mali empire in 137 ##5 and the song ##hai empire in 159 ##1 . additionally , as inland regions underwent desert ##ification , inhabitants moved to the wet ##ter coast . these new inhabitants brought skills such as cotton spinning , cloth weaving , iron sm ##elt ##ing , rice and so ##rgh ##um cultivation , and social and political institutions from the mali and song ##hai empires . shortly after the mane conquered the region , the va ##i people of the former mali empire immigrated into the grand cape mount region . the ethnic k ##ru opposed the influx of va ##i , forming an alliance with the mane to stop further influx of va ##i .

for crimes against humanity [SEP] in march 2003 , a second rebel group , movement for democracy in liberia , began launching attacks against taylor from the southeast . peace talks between the factions began in acc ##ra in june of that year , and taylor was indicted by the special court for sierra leone for crimes against humanity that same month . by july 2003 , the rebels had launched an assault on mon ##rov ##ia . under heavy pressure from the international community and the domestic women of liberia mass action for peace movement , taylor resigned in august 2003 and went into exile in nigeria .
economic mis ##mana ##gement following the 1980 coup . [SEP] following a peak in growth in 1979 , the liberia ##n economy began a steady decline due to economic mis ##mana ##gement following the 1980 coup . this decline was accelerated by the outbreak of civil war in 1989 ; gdp was reduced by an estimated 90 % between 1989 and 1995 , one of the fastest declines in history . upon the end of the war in 2003 , gdp growth began to accelerate , reaching 9 . 4 % in 2007 . the global financial crisis slowed gdp growth to 4 . 6 % in 2009 , though a strengthening agricultural sector led by rubber and timber exports increased growth to 5 . 1 % in 2010 and an expected 7 . 3 % in 2011 , making the economy one of the 20 fastest growing in the world .

were believed to be funding rebels in sierra leone . [SEP] in 2003 , additional un sanctions were placed on liberia ##n timber exports , which had risen from us $ 5 million in 1997 to over us $ 100 million in 2002 and were believed to be funding rebels in sierra leone . these sanctions were lifted in 2006 . due in large part to foreign aid and investment in ##flow following the end of the war , liberia maintains a large account deficit , which peaked at nearly 60 % in 2008 . liberia gained observer status with the world trade organization in 2010 and is in the process of acquiring full member status .
his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death [SEP] the two volume biography of whitehead by victor lowe is the most definitive presentation of the life of whitehead . however , many details of whitehead ' s life remain obscure because he left no na ##ch ##lass ; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death . additionally , whitehead was known for his " almost fan ##atic ##al belief in the right to privacy " , and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life . this led to lowe himself remark ##ing on the first page of whitehead ' s biography , " no professional biographer in his right mind would touch him . "
the three - volume work was so massive ( more than 2 , 000 pages ) and its audience so narrow ( professional mathematicians ) [SEP] whitehead and russell had thought originally that pri ##nc ##ip ##ia math ##ema ##tica would take a year to complete ; it ended up taking them ten years . to add insult to injury , when it came time for publication , the three - volume work was so massive ( more than 2 , 000 pages ) and its audience so narrow ( professional mathematicians ) that it was initially published at a loss of 600 pounds , 300 of which was paid by cambridge university press , 200 by the royal society of london , and 50 api ##ece by whitehead and russell themselves . despite the initial loss , today there is likely no major academic library in the world which does not hold a copy of pri ##nc ##ip ##ia math ##ema ##tica .
god ##el could not have come to this conclusion without whitehead and russell ' s book [SEP] the ultimate substantive legacy of pri ##nc ##ip ##ia math ##ema ##tica is mixed . it is generally accepted that kurt god ##el ' s incomplete ##ness theorem of 1931 definitive ##ly demonstrated that for any set of ax ##ioms and inference rules proposed to en ##cap ##sul ##ate mathematics , there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be de ##duced from them , and hence that pri ##nc ##ip ##ia math ##ema ##tica could never achieve its aims . however , god ##el could not have come to this conclusion without whitehead and russell ' s book . in this way , pri ##nc ##ip ##ia math ##ema ##tica ' s legacy might be described as its key role in di ##sp ##roving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals . but beyond this somewhat ironic legacy , the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic , ep ##iste ##mology , and meta ##physics .
hired [SEP] however , mathews ' frustration with whitehead ' s books did not negatively affect his interest . in fact , there were numerous philosophers and theologians at chicago ' s divinity school that perceived the importance of what whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications . in 1927 they invited one of america ' s only whitehead experts – henry nelson wi ##eman – to chicago to give a lecture explaining whitehead ' s thought . wi ##eman ' s lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years , and for at least thirty years afterward chicago ' s divinity school was closely associated with whitehead ' s thought .
these " classical " concepts fail to adequately account for change , and overlook the active and ex ##per ##ient ##ial nature of the most basic elements of the world . [SEP] in whitehead ' s view , then , concepts such as " quality " , " matter " , and " form " are problematic . these " classical " concepts fail to adequately account for change , and overlook the active and ex ##per ##ient ##ial nature of the most basic elements of the world . they are useful abstraction ##s , but are not the world ' s basic building blocks . what is or ##dina ##rily conceived of as a single person , for instance , is philosophical ##ly described as a continuum of overlapping events . after all , people change all the time , if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience . these occasions of experience are logical ##ly distinct , but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a " society " of events . by assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe , material ##ists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete ( what whitehead calls the " fall ##acy of mis ##placed concrete ##ness " ) .
it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things [SEP] whitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main cu ##lp ##rit ##s in maintaining a material ##istic way of thinking , and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech . after all , each moment of each person ' s life can hardly be given a different proper name , and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things , rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago . yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that " material substances " or " essence ##s " are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular , concrete processes . no one questions that a ten - year - old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old , and in many ways is not the same person at all ; whitehead points out that it is not philosophical ##ly or onto ##logical ##ly sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next .
his system required that an order exist among possibilities , an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities . [SEP] it should be emphasized , however , that for whitehead god is not necessarily tied to religion . rather than spring ##ing primarily from religious faith , whitehead saw god as necessary for his metaphysical system . his system required that an order exist among possibilities , an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities . whitehead po ##sit ##ed that these ordered potential ##s exist in what he called the pri ##mo ##rdial nature of god . however , whitehead was also interested in religious experience . this led him to reflect more intensive ##ly on what he saw as the second nature of god , the con ##se ##quent nature . whitehead ' s conception of god as a " dip ##olar " entity has called for fresh theological thinking .
inter ##de ##pen ##den ##ce of humanity and nature , as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts [SEP] but while claremont remains the most concentrated hub of whitehead ##ian activity , the place where whitehead ' s thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in china . in order to address the challenges of modernization and industrial ##ization , china has begun to blend traditions of tao ##ism , buddhism , and con ##fu ##cian ##ism with whitehead ' s " constructive post - modern " philosophy in order to create an " ecological civilization . " to date , the chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty - three university - based centers for the study of whitehead ' s philosophy , and books by process philosophers john cobb and david ray griffin are becoming required reading for chinese graduate students . cobb has attributed china ' s interest in process philosophy partly to whitehead ' s stress on the mutual inter ##de ##pen ##den ##ce of humanity and nature , as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts .
the sheer difficulty and density of his prose [SEP] del ##eu ##ze ' s and la ##tour ' s opinions , however , are minority ones , as whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools . it is impossible to say exactly why whitehead ' s influence has not been more widespread , but it may be partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counter - intuitive ( such as his assertion that matter is an abstraction ) , or his inclusion of the ##istic elements in his philosophy , or the perception of meta ##physics itself as pass ##e , or simply the sheer difficulty and density of his prose .
people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joy ##s or sorrow ##s of his followers – so why would this be a praise - worthy quality in god ? [SEP] process theology typically stresses god ' s relational nature . rather than seeing god as imp ##ass ##ive or emotion ##less , process theologians view god as " the fellow suffer ##er who understands " , and as the being who is supreme ##ly affected by temporal events . hart ##sho ##rne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joy ##s or sorrow ##s of his followers – so why would this be a praise - worthy quality in god ? instead , as the being who is most affected by the world , god is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world . however , process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways . c . robert me ##sle , for instance , advocates a " process natural ##ism " , i . e . a process theology without god .

process theologians are so diverse and trans ##dis ##ci ##plin ##ary in their views and interests [SEP] in fact , process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and trans ##dis ##ci ##plin ##ary in their views and interests . john b . cobb , jr . is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics . roland faber and catherine keller integrate whitehead with posts ##truct ##ural ##ist , post ##col ##onia ##list , and feminist theory . charles birch was both a theologian and a genetic ##ist . franklin i . ga ##m ##well writes on theology and political theory . in synth ##eis ##m - creating god in the internet age , fu ##tur ##ologists alexander bard and jan so ##der ##qvist repeatedly credit whitehead for the process theology they see rising out of the part ##ici ##pa ##tory culture expected to dominate the digital era .
develop resistance [SEP] antibiotics revolution ##ized medicine in the 20th century , and have together with va ##cci ##nation led to the near era ##dication of diseases such as tuberculosis in the developed world . their effectiveness and easy access led to over ##use , especially in livestock raising , prompting bacteria to develop resistance . this has led to widespread problems with anti ##mic ##ro ##bial and anti ##biotic resistance , so much as to prompt the world health organization to classify anti ##mic ##ro ##bial resistance as a " serious threat [ that ] is no longer a prediction for the future , it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone , of any age , in any country " .

disruption of the species composition in the int ##estinal flora [SEP] antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use , and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated . however , some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects . side - effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used , the micro ##bial organisms targeted , and the individual patient . side effects may reflect the ph ##arm ##aco ##logical or toxic ##ological properties of the anti ##biotic or may involve hyper ##sen ##sit ##ivity reactions or ana ##phy ##la ##xi ##s . safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use . adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions , including photo ##der ##mat ##itis and ana ##phy ##la ##xi ##s . common side - effects include dia ##rr ##hea , resulting from disruption of the species composition in the int ##estinal flora , resulting , for example , in over ##growth of pathogen ##ic bacteria , such as cl ##ost ##rid ##ium di ##ffi ##ci ##le . anti ##ba ##cter ##ials can also affect the va ##ginal flora , and may lead to over ##growth of yeast species of the genus candi ##da in the vu ##l ##vo - va ##ginal area . additional side - effects can result from interaction with other drugs , such as elevated risk of tend ##on damage from administration of a qui ##no ##lone anti ##biotic with a systemic co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid . some scientists have h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that the ind ##is ##cr ##imi ##nate use of antibiotics alter the host micro ##bio ##ta and this has been associated with chronic disease .
negative effects on humans or other mammals [SEP] antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use , and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated . however , some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects . side - effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used , the micro ##bial organisms targeted , and the individual patient . side effects may reflect the ph ##arm ##aco ##logical or toxic ##ological properties of the anti ##biotic or may involve hyper ##sen ##sit ##ivity reactions or ana ##phy ##la ##xi ##s . safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use . adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions , including photo ##der ##mat ##itis and ana ##phy ##la ##xi ##s . common side - effects include dia ##rr ##hea , resulting from disruption of the species composition in the int ##estinal flora , resulting , for example , in over ##growth of pathogen ##ic bacteria , such as cl ##ost ##rid ##ium di ##ffi ##ci ##le . anti ##ba ##cter ##ials can also affect the va ##ginal flora , and may lead to over ##growth of yeast species of the genus candi ##da in the vu ##l ##vo - va ##ginal area . additional side - effects can result from interaction with other drugs , such as elevated risk of tend ##on damage from administration of a qui ##no ##lone anti ##biotic with a systemic co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid . some scientists have h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that the ind ##is ##cr ##imi ##nate use of antibiotics alter the host micro ##bio ##ta and this has been associated with chronic disease .
weighed against the beneficial effects [SEP] exposure to antibiotics early in life is associated with increased body mass in humans and mouse models . early life is a critical period for the establishment of the int ##estinal micro ##bio ##ta and for metabolic development . mice exposed to sub ##ther ##ape ##uti ##c anti ##biotic treatment ( stat ) – with either pen ##ici ##llin , van ##com ##y ##cin , pen ##ici ##llin and van ##com ##y ##cin , or ch ##lor ##tet ##rac ##y ##cl ##ine had altered composition of the gut micro ##bio ##ta as well as its metabolic capabilities . moreover , research have shown that mice given low - dose pen ##ici ##llin ( 1 μ ##g / g body weight ) around birth and throughout the we ##ani ##ng process had an increased body mass and fat mass , accelerated growth , and increased he ##pati ##c expression of genes involved in adi ##po ##genesis , compared to controlled mice . in addition , pen ##ici ##llin in combination with a high - fat diet increased fast ##ing insulin levels in mice . however , it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause obesity in humans . studies have found a correlation between early exposure of antibiotics ( < 6 months ) and increased body mass ( at 10 and 20 months ) . another study found that the type of anti ##biotic exposure was also significant with the highest risk of being over ##weight in those given macro ##lide ##s compared to pen ##ici ##llin and ce ##pha ##los ##por ##in . therefore , there is correlation between anti ##biotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans , but whether or not there is a causal relationship remains unclear . although there is a correlation between anti ##biotic use in early life and obesity , the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans needs to be weighed against the beneficial effects of clinical ##ly indicated treatment with antibiotics in infancy .
inappropriate anti ##biotic treatment [SEP] common forms of anti ##biotic mis ##use include excessive use of prop ##hyl ##actic antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to pre ##scribe the correct dos ##age of antibiotics on the basis of the patient ' s weight and history of prior use . other forms of mis ##use include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the anti ##biotic , incorrect dos ##age and administration , or failure to rest for sufficient recovery . inappropriate anti ##biotic treatment , for example , is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the common cold . one study on respiratory tract infections found " physicians were more likely to pre ##scribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them " . multi ##fa ##ctor ##ial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics .
hi ##ber ##nate ##s the windows kernel on shut ##down to speed up the subsequent boot [SEP] new features and functionality in windows 8 include a faster startup through u ##ef ##i integration and the new " hybrid boot " mode ( which hi ##ber ##nate ##s the windows kernel on shut ##down to speed up the subsequent boot ) , a new lock screen with a clock and notification ##s , and the ability for enterprise users to create live usb versions of windows ( known as windows to go ) . windows 8 also adds native support for usb 3 . 0 devices , which allow for faster data transfers and improved power management with compatible devices , and hard disk 4 ##k ##b advanced format support , as well as support for near field communication to facilitate sharing and communication between devices .
the cost of licensing the necessary deco ##ders [SEP] several notable features have been removed in windows 8 , beginning with the traditional start menu . support for playing dvd - video was removed from windows media player due to the cost of licensing the necessary deco ##ders ( especially for devices which do not include optical disc drives at all ) and the prevalence of online streaming services . for the same reasons , windows media center is not included by default on windows 8 , but windows media center and dvd playback support can be purchased in the " pro pack " ( which upgrades the system to windows 8 pro ) or " media center pack " add - on for windows 8 pro . as with prior versions , third - party dvd player software can still be used to enable dvd playback .
to allow " greater design flexibility " for future products [SEP] microsoft released minimum hardware requirements for tablet and lap ##let devices to be " certified " for windows 8 , and defined a convertible form factor as a standalone device that combines the pc , display and rec ##har ##ge ##able power source with a mechanically attached keyboard and pointing device in a single chassis . a convertible can be transformed into a tablet where the attached input devices are hidden or removed leaving the display as the only input mechanism . on march 12 , 2013 , microsoft amended its certification requirements to only require that screens on tablets have a minimum resolution of 102 ##4 ##× ##7 ##6 ##8 ( down from the previous 136 ##6 ##× ##7 ##6 ##8 ) . the amended requirement is intended to allow " greater design flexibility " for future products .
to ensure that the system only runs applications that are opt ##imi ##zed for the architecture [SEP] windows rt , the only edition of windows 8 for systems with arm processors , only supports applications included with the system ( such as a special version of office 2013 ) , supplied through windows update , or windows store apps , to ensure that the system only runs applications that are opt ##imi ##zed for the architecture . windows rt does not support running ia - 32 or x ##64 applications . windows store apps can either support both the x ##86 and arm architecture ##s , or compiled to support a specific architecture .
because it allows users to interact with dynamic information [SEP] reviews of the various editions of windows 8 have been mixed . tom warren of the verge said that although windows 8 ' s emphasis on touch computing was significant and risked alien ##ating desktop users , a " tablet pc with windows 8 makes an ipad feel immediately out of date " due to the capabilities of the operating system ' s hybrid model and increased focus on cloud services . david pierce of the verge described windows 8 as " the first desktop operating system that understands what a computer is supposed to do in 2012 " and praised microsoft ' s " no compromise " approach and the operating system ' s emphasis on internet connectivity and cloud services . pierce also considered the start screen to be a " brilliant innovation for desktop computers " when compared with " folder - littered desktop ##s on every other os " because it allows users to interact with dynamic information . in contrast , an extreme ##tech article said it was microsoft " fl ##ailing " and a review in pc magazine condemned the metro - style user interface . some of the included apps in windows 8 were considered to be basic and lacking in functionality , but the xbox apps were praised for their promotion of a multi - platform entertainment experience . other improvements and features ( such as file history , storage spaces , and the updated task manager ) were also regarded as positive changes . peter bright of ars tech ##nica wrote that while its user interface changes may overs ##had ##ow them , windows 8 ' s improved performance , updated file manager , new storage functionality , expanded security features , and updated task manager were still positive improvements for the operating system . bright also said that windows 8 ' s dual ##ity towards tablets and traditional pcs was an " extremely ambitious " aspect of the platform as well , but criticized microsoft for em ##ulating apple ' s model of a closed distribution platform when implementing the windows store .
to allow the production of certified windows 8 tablets in smaller form factors [SEP] in march 2013 , microsoft also amended its certification requirements to allow tablets to use the 102 ##4 ##× ##7 ##6 ##8 resolution as a minimum ; this change is expected to allow the production of certified windows 8 tablets in smaller form factors — a market which is currently dominated by android - based tablets . despite the reaction of industry experts , microsoft reported that they had sold 100 million licenses in the first six months . this matched sales of windows 7 over a similar period . this stat ##istic includes shipments to channel warehouses which now need to be sold in order to make way for new shipments .
in protest of microsoft ' s support life ##cycle policy and the end of support for windows xp [SEP] in may 2014 , the government of china banned the internal purchase of windows 8 - based products under government contracts requiring " energy - efficient " devices . the xi ##nh ##ua news agency claimed that windows 8 was being banned in protest of microsoft ' s support life ##cycle policy and the end of support for windows xp ( which , as of january 2014 , had a market share of 49 % in china ) , as the government " obviously cannot ignore the risks of running os [ sic ] without guaranteed technical support . " however , ni gu ##ang ##nan of the chinese academy of sciences had also previously warned that windows 8 could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the united states government due to its heavy use of internet - based services .
to balance views in parliament [SEP] the king appoint ##s the prime minister from the legislature and also appoint ##s a minority of legislators to both chambers of the li ##band ##la ( parliament ) with help from an advisory council . the king is allowed by the constitution to appoint some members to parliament for special interests . these special interests are citizens who might have been left out by the electorate during the course of elections or did not enter as candidates . this is done to balance views in parliament . special interests could be people of gender , race , disability , the business community , civic society , scholars , chiefs and so on .
exports grew by over 200 % [SEP] the sw ##azi economy is very closely linked to the economy of south africa , from which it receives over 90 % of its imports and to which it sends about 70 % of its exports . sw ##azi ##land ' s other key trading partners are the united states and the eu , from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports ( under the african growth and opportunity act – ago ##a – to the us ) and for sugar ( to the eu ) . under these agreements , both apparel and sugar exports did well , with rapid growth and a strong in ##flow of foreign direct investment . textile exports grew by over 200 % between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50 % over the same period .
centuries of close contacts and exchanges [SEP] arabic translation efforts and techniques are important to western translation traditions due to centuries of close contacts and exchanges . especially after the renaissance , europeans began more intensive study of arabic and persian translations of classical works as well as scientific and philosophical works of arab and oriental origins . arabic and , to a lesser degree , persian became important sources of material and perhaps of techniques for rev ##ital ##ized western traditions , which in time would over ##take the islamic and oriental traditions .
little or no freedom to choose between a ve ##rs ##ified translation [SEP] translation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry , because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a ve ##rs ##ified translation and a translation that di ##sp ##ense ##s with verse structure . one might modify or om ##it rhyme in a singing translation , but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator . there is the option in prose sung texts , less so in verse , of adding or del ##eti ##ng a syllable here and there by sub ##di ##vid ##ing or combining notes , respectively , but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original pro ##so ##dy of the sung melodic line .
seventy translators [SEP] one of the first recorded instances of translation in the west was the rendering of the old testament into greek in the 3rd century bce . the translation is known as the " sept ##ua ##gin ##t " , a name that refers to the seventy translators ( seventy - two , in some versions ) who were commissioned to translate the bible at alexandria , egypt . each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell , and according to legend all seventy versions proved identical . the sept ##ua ##gin ##t became the source text for later translations into many languages , including latin , coptic , armenian and georgian .
increase in jet aircraft traffic [SEP] airport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in jet aircraft traffic . runways were extended out to 3 , 000 m ( 9 , 800 ft ) . the fields were constructed out of reinforced concrete using a slip - form machine that produces a continual slab with no disruption ##s along the length . the early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals , an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding . these systems became commonplace in the united states by the 1970s .
abundant supply of fur ##s , bees ##wa ##x , honey , and slaves for export [SEP] the new kiev ##an state pro ##sper ##ed due to its abundant supply of fur ##s , bees ##wa ##x , honey , and slaves for export , and because it controlled three main trade routes of eastern europe . in the north , novgorod served as a commercial link between the baltic sea and the volga trade route to the lands of the volga bu ##lga ##rs , the k ##ha ##zar ##s , and across the caspian sea as far as baghdad , providing access to markets and products from central asia and the middle east . trade from the baltic also moved south on a network of rivers and short portage ##s along the d ##nie ##per known as the " route from the var ##ang ##ians to the greeks , " continuing to the black sea and on to constantinople . kiev was a central outpost along the d ##nie ##per route and a hub with the east - west overland trade route between the k ##ha ##zar ##s and the germanic lands of central europe . these commercial connections enriched rus ' merchants and princes , funding military forces and the construction of churches , palaces , fortifications , and further towns . demand for luxury goods foster ##ed production of expensive jewelry and religious ware ##s , allowing their export , and an advanced credit and money - lending system may have also been in place .
byzantine fleet was occupied with the arabs [SEP] in 94 ##1 , igor led another major rus ' attack on constantinople , probably over trading rights again . a navy of 10 , 000 vessels , including pe ##chen ##eg allies , landed on the bit ##hy ##nian coast and devastated the asiatic shore of the bo ##sp ##hor ##us . the attack was well - timed , perhaps due to intelligence , as the byzantine fleet was occupied with the arabs in the mediterranean , and the bulk of its army was stationed in the east . the rus ’ burned towns , churches , and monasteries , butcher ##ing the people and ama ##ssing boot ##y . the emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be outfit ##ted with greek fire throw ##ers and sent them out to meet the rus ’ , lu ##ring them into surrounding the contingent before un ##lea ##shing the greek fire . liu ##tp ##rand of cr ##emon ##a wrote that " the rus ' , seeing the flames , jumped overboard , preferring water to fire . some sank , weighed down by the weight of their breast ##plate ##s and helmets ; others caught fire . " those captured were beheaded . the pl ##oy di ##sp ##elled the rus ’ fleet , but their attacks continued into the hint ##erland as far as nico ##media , with many atrocities reported as victims were cr ##uc ##ified and set up for use as targets . at last a byzantine army arrived from the balkans to drive the rus ' back , and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the rus ' fleet on its return voyage ( possibly an ex ##agger ##ation since the rus ' soon mounted another attack ) . the outcome indicates increased military might by by ##zan ##tium since 911 , suggesting a shift in the balance of power .
it controlled trade routes [SEP] in the north , the republic of novgorod pro ##sper ##ed because it controlled trade routes from the river volga to the baltic sea . as kiev ##an rus ' declined , novgorod became more independent . a local ol ##iga ##rchy ruled novgorod ; major government decisions were made by a town assembly , which also elected a prince as the city ' s military leader . in the 12th century , novgorod acquired its own archbishop il ##ya in 116 ##9 , a sign of increased importance and political independence , while about 30 years prior to that in 113 ##6 in novgorod was established a republican form of government - elect ##ive monarchy . since then novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the kiev ##an rus .

if the sections of the cas ##ing came from different batch ##es of plastic [SEP] the abs plastic used in the cas ##ing of some older s ##nes and super fa ##mic ##om consoles is particularly susceptible to ox ##idi ##zation on exposure to air , likely due to an incorrect mixture of the stab ##ili ##zing or flame re ##tar ##ding additive ##s . this , along with the particularly light color of the original plastic , causes affected consoles to quickly become yellow ; if the sections of the cas ##ing came from different batch ##es of plastic , a " two - tone " effect results . the color can sometimes be restored with uv light and a hydrogen per ##oxide solution .
collapsed [SEP] although short - lived , one of the first empires known to history was that of ea ##nna ##tum of la ##gas ##h , who annexed practically all of sum ##er , including ki ##sh , ur ##uk , ur , and lars ##a , and reduced to tribute the city - state of umm ##a , arch - rival of la ##gas ##h . in addition , his realm extended to parts of el ##am and along the persian gulf . he seems to have used terror as a matter of policy . ea ##nna ##tum ' s ste ##le of the vulture ##s depicts vulture ##s peck ##ing at the severed heads and other body parts of his enemies . his empire collapsed shortly after his death .
si ##lt deposited by the ti ##gr ##is and the eu ##ph ##rates rivers [SEP] the sum ##erian ##s were a non - semitic ca ##uca ##so ##id people , and spoke a language isolate ; a number of linguist ##s believed they could detect a substrate language beneath sum ##erian , because names of some of sum ##er ' s major cities are not sum ##erian , revealing influences of earlier inhabitants . however , the archaeological record shows clear un ##int ##er ##rup ##ted cultural continuity from the time of the early u ##bai ##d period ( 530 ##0 – 470 ##0 bc c - 14 ) settlements in southern mesopotamia . the sum ##erian people who settled here farm ##ed the lands in this region that were made fertile by si ##lt deposited by the ti ##gr ##is and the eu ##ph ##rates rivers .
belongs to no known language family [SEP] the sum ##erian language is generally regarded as a language isolate in linguistics because it belongs to no known language family ; ak ##ka ##dian , by contrast , belongs to the semitic branch of the afro ##asia ##tic languages . there have been many failed attempts to connect sum ##erian to other language groups . it is an ag ##gl ##uti ##nat ##ive language ; in other words , mor ##ph ##eme ##s ( " units of meaning " ) are added together to create words , unlike analytic languages where mor ##ph ##eme ##s are purely added together to create sentences . some authors have proposed that there may be evidence of a sub - st ##rat ##um or add - st ##rat ##um language for geographic features and various crafts and agricultural activities , called variously proto - eu ##ph ##rate ##an or proto ti ##gre ##an , but this is disputed by others .
for the purpose of serving them [SEP] these deities formed a core pantheon ; there were additionally hundreds of minor ones . sum ##erian gods could thus have associations with different cities , and their religious importance often wax ##ed and wan ##ed with those cities ' political power . the gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them . the temples organized the mass labour projects needed for irrigation agriculture . citizens had a labor duty to the temple , though they could avoid it by a payment of silver .
kill weeds [SEP] as is known from the " sum ##erian farmer ' s alma ##nac " , after the flood season and after the spring e ##quin ##ox and the ak ##it ##u or new year festival , using the canals , farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water . next they made ox ##en st ##omp the ground and kill weeds . they then dragged the fields with pick ##ax ##es . after drying , they pl ##owed , harrow ##ed , and raked the ground three times , and pu ##lver ##ized it with a matt ##ock , before planting seed . unfortunately the high eva ##por ##ation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the sal ##ini ##ty of the fields . by the ur iii period , farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt - tolerant barley as their principal crop .
to prevent debts mounting to a degree that they threatened fighting force [SEP] periodically " clean slate " decrees were signed by rulers which cancelled all the rural ( but not commercial ) debt and allowed bonds ##er ##vant ##s to return to their homes . custom ##ari ##ly rulers did it at the beginning of the first full year of their reign , but they could also be proclaimed at times of military conflict or crop failure . the first known ones were made by en ##met ##ena and ur ##uka ##gina of la ##gas ##h in 240 ##0 - 235 ##0 bc . according to hudson , the purpose of these decrees was to prevent debts mounting to a degree that they threatened fighting force which could happen if peasants lost the subsistence land or became bonds ##er ##vant ##s due to the inability to repay the debt .

authorized those dioceses that wished to introduce the feast to do so , and introduced it to his own diocese of rome in 147 ##7 [SEP] on 28 february 147 ##6 , pope six ##tus iv , authorized those dioceses that wished to introduce the feast to do so , and introduced it to his own diocese of rome in 147 ##7 , with a specially composed mass and office of the feast . with his bull cum pr ##ae ##ex ##cel ##sa of 28 february 147 ##7 , in which he referred to the feast as that of the conception of mary , without using the word " immaculate " , he granted ind ##ul ##gence ##s to those who would participate in the specially composed mass or office on the feast itself or during its octave , and he used the word " immaculate " of mary , but applied instead the adjective " miraculous " to her conception . on 4 september 148 ##3 , referring to the feast as that of " the conception of immaculate mary ever virgin " , he condemned both those who called it mortally sin ##ful and here ##tical to hold that the " glorious and immaculate mother of god was conceived without the stain of original sin " and those who called it mortally sin ##ful and here ##tical to hold that " the glorious virgin mary was conceived with original sin " , since , he said , " up to this time there has been no decision made by the roman church and the apostolic see . " this decree was re ##af ##firmed by the council of trent .
declared " doctor angel ##icus " of the church in 156 ##7 [SEP] popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of mary ' s conception . in 143 ##9 , the council of basel , which is not reckon ##ed an ecumenical council , stated that belief in the immaculate conception of mary is in accord with the catholic faith . by the end of the 15th century the belief was widely prof ##essed and taught in many theological faculties , but such was the influence of the dominican ##s , and the weight of the arguments of thomas a ##quin ##as ( who had been canon ##ised in 132 ##3 and declared " doctor angel ##icus " of the church in 156 ##7 ) that the council of trent ( 154 ##5 – 63 ) — which might have been expected to af ##firm the doctrine — instead declined to take a position .
internal violence [SEP] uprising ##s and demands by african leaders led the un to assume direct responsibility over the territory . it recognised the south west africa people ' s organisation ( swap ##o ) as the official representative of the namibia ##n people in 1973 . namibia , however , remained under south african administration during this time as south - west africa . following internal violence , south africa installed an interim administration in namibia in 1985 . namibia obtained full independence from south africa in 1990 , with the exception of wal ##vis bay and the penguin islands , which remained under south african control until 1994 .
un peace plan [SEP] in response to the 1966 ruling by the international court of justice , south - west africa people ' s organisation ( swap ##o ) military wing , people ' s liberation army of namibia , a guerrilla group began their armed struggle for independence , but it was not until 1988 that south africa agreed to end its occupation of namibia , in accordance with a un peace plan for the entire region . during the south african occupation of namibia , white commercial farmers , most of whom came as settlers from south africa and represented 0 . 2 % of the national population , owned 74 % of the arab ##le land . outside the central - southern area of namibia ( known as the " police zone " since the german era and which contained the main towns , industries , mines and best arab ##le land ) , the country was divided into " homeland ##s " , the version of south african ban ##tus ##tan applied to namibia , although only a few were actually established because indigenous namibia ##ns often did not cooperate .
became prove ##rb ##s or saying ##s which can be frequently found even in modern russian col ##lo ##qui ##al speech [SEP] the modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of alexander push ##kin ( а ##л ##е ##к ##с ##ан ##д ##р п ##у ##ш ##к ##и ##н ) in the first third of the 19th century . push ##kin revolution ##ized russian literature by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary ( so - called " в ##ы ##с ##о ##к ##ии с ##т ##и ##л ##ь " — " high style " ) in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time . even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in push ##kin ' s texts , since relatively few words used by push ##kin have become archaic or changed meaning . in fact , many expressions used by russian writers of the early 19th century , in particular push ##kin , mikhail le ##rm ##ont ##ov ( м ##и ##х ##а ##и ##л л ##е ##р ##м ##о ##н ##т ##ов ) , nikolai go ##gol ( н ##и ##к ##о ##л ##а ##и г ##о ##г ##о ##л ##ь ) , ale ##ks ##ander gr ##ib ##oy ##edo ##v ( а ##л ##е ##к ##с ##ан ##д ##р г ##р ##и ##б ##о ##е ##д ##ов ) , became prove ##rb ##s or saying ##s which can be frequently found even in modern russian col ##lo ##qui ##al speech .
budget constraints [SEP] in 2007 , the usaf undertook a reduction - in - force ( ri ##f ) . because of budget constraints , the usaf planned to reduce the service ' s size from 360 , 000 active duty personnel to 316 , 000 . the size of the active duty force in 2007 was roughly 64 % of that of what the usaf was at the end of the first gulf war in 1991 . however , the reduction was ended at approximately 330 , 000 personnel in 2008 in order to meet the demand signal of combat ##ant commanders and associated mission requirements . these same constraints have seen a sharp reduction in flight hours for crew training since 2005 and the deputy chief of staff for manpower and personnel directing airmen ' s time assessments .
budget se ##quest ##ration [SEP] due to the budget se ##quest ##ration in 2013 , the usaf was forced to ground many of its squadrons . the commander of air combat command , general mike hostage indicated that the usaf must reduce its f - 15 and f - 16 fleets and eliminate platforms like the a - 10 in order to focus on a fifth - generation jet fighter future . in response to squadron ground ##ings and flight time reductions , many air force pilots have opted to resign from active duty and enter the air force reserve and air national guard while pursuing careers in the commercial airlines where they can find flight hours on more modern aircraft .
large aircraft losses in training [SEP] cultural and career issues in the u . s . air force have been cited as one of the reasons for the short ##fall in needed ua ##v operators . in spite of an urgent need for ua ##vs or drones to provide round the clock coverage for american troops during the iraq war , the usaf did not establish a new career field for pilot ##ing them until the last year of that war and in 2014 changed its r ##pa training sy ##lla ##bus again , in the face of large aircraft losses in training , and in response to a gao report critical of handling of drone programs . paul sc ##har ##re has reported that the cultural divide between the usaf and us army has kept both services from adopting each other ' s drone handing innovations .
more expensive [SEP] recent developments in led ##s permit them to be used in environmental and task lighting . led ##s have many advantages over inca ##nde ##scent light sources including lower energy consumption , longer lifetime , improved physical robust ##ness , smaller size , and faster switching . light - emi ##tting di ##odes are now used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting , automotive head ##lam ##ps , advertising , general lighting , traffic signals , camera flashes and lighted wall ##paper . as of 2015 [ update ] , led ##s powerful enough for room lighting remain somewhat more expensive , and require more precise current and heat management , than compact fluorescent lamp sources of comparable output .
to rec ##om ##bine the electrons and the holes [SEP] a p - n junction can convert absorbed light energy into a proportional electric current . the same process is reversed here ( i . e . the p - n junction emi ##ts light when electrical energy is applied to it ) . this phenomenon is generally called electro ##lum ##ines ##cence , which can be defined as the emission of light from a semi - conductor under the influence of an electric field . the charge carriers rec ##om ##bine in a forward - biased p - n junction as the electrons cross from the n - region and rec ##om ##bine with the holes existing in the p - region . free electrons are in the conduct ##ion band of energy levels , while holes are in the vale ##nce energy band . thus the energy level of the holes will be lesser than the energy levels of the electrons . some portion of the energy must be dissipated in order to rec ##om ##bine the electrons and the holes . this energy is emitted in the form of heat and light .
heat loss from the stokes shift [SEP] ph ##os ##ph ##or - based led efficiency losses are due to the heat loss from the stokes shift and also other ph ##os ##ph ##or - related degradation issues . their luminous e ##ffi ##ca ##cies compared to normal led ##s depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the led itself . for example , the luminous efficacy of a typical ya ##g yellow ph ##os ##ph ##or based white led ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue led because of the human eye ' s greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue ( as modeled in the lu ##min ##osity function ) . due to the simplicity of manufacturing the ph ##os ##ph ##or method is still the most popular method for making high - intensity white led ##s . the design and production of a light source or light fixture using a mono ##chrome emi ##tter with ph ##os ##ph ##or conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex r ##gb system , and the majority of high - intensity white led ##s presently on the market are manufactured using ph ##os ##ph ##or light conversion .
a small change in voltage [SEP] the current – voltage characteristic of an led is similar to other di ##odes , in that the current is dependent exponential ##ly on the voltage ( see shock ##ley di ##ode equation ) . this means that a small change in voltage can cause a large change in current . if the applied voltage exceeds the led ' s forward voltage drop by a small amount , the current rating may be exceeded by a large amount , potentially damaging or destroying the led . the typical solution is to use constant - current power supplies to keep the current below the led ' s maximum current rating . since most common power sources ( batteries , main ##s ) are constant - voltage sources , most led fixtures must include a power convert ##er , at least a current - limiting resist ##or . however , the high resistance of three - vol ##t coin cells combined with the high differential resistance of ni ##tri ##de - based led ##s makes it possible to power such an led from such a coin cell without an external resist ##or .
their long life [SEP] because of their long life , fast switching times , and their ability to be seen in broad daylight due to their high output and focus , led ##s have been used in brake lights for cars ' high - mounted brake lights , trucks , and buses , and in turn signals for some time , but many vehicles now use led ##s for their rear light clusters . the use in brakes improves safety , due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully , or faster rise time , up to 0 . 5 second faster [ citation needed ] than an inca ##nde ##scent bulb . this gives drivers behind more time to react . in a dual intensity circuit ( rear markers and brakes ) if the led ##s are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency , they can create a phantom array , where ghost images of the led will appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array . white led head ##lam ##ps are starting to be used . using led ##s has styling advantages because led ##s can form much thinner lights than inca ##nde ##scent lamps with para ##bolic reflect ##ors .
so features of interest are easier to process [SEP] machine vision systems often require bright and homogeneous illumination , so features of interest are easier to process . led ##s are often used for this purpose , and this is likely to remain one of their major uses until the price drops low enough to make signaling and illumination uses more widespread . bar ##code scanner ##s are the most common example of machine vision , and many low cost products use red led ##s instead of lasers . optical computer mice are an example of led ##s in machine vision , as it is used to provide an even light source on the surface for the miniature camera within the mouse . led ##s constitute a nearly ideal light source for machine vision systems for several reasons :
against the ratification of the treaty of versailles , thus preventing american participation in the league [SEP] the victorious great powers also gained an acknowledge ##ment of their status through permanent seats at the league of nations council , where they acted as a type of executive body directing the assembly of the league . however , the council began with only four permanent members — the united kingdom , france , italy , and japan — because the united states , meant to be the fifth permanent member , left because the us senate voted on 19 march 1920 against the ratification of the treaty of versailles , thus preventing american participation in the league .
because they include the ancestors of modern birds [SEP] many species of the second major av ##ial ##an lineage to divers ##ify , the eu ##orn ##ith ##es ( meaning " true birds " , because they include the ancestors of modern birds ) , were semi - aquatic and specialized in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms . unlike the en ##ant ##ior ##ni ##thes , which dominated land - based and arbor ##eal habitats , most early eu ##orn ##ith ##es lacked perch ##ing adaptations and seem to have included shore ##bird - like species , wade ##rs , and swimming and diving species . the later included the superficial ##ly gu ##ll - like ich ##thy ##orn ##is , the he ##sper ##orn ##ith ##iform ##es , which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic . the early eu ##orn ##ith ##es also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds , like strongly keel ##ed breast ##bone ##s , tooth ##less , beak ##ed portions of their jaws ( though most non - av ##ian eu ##orn ##ith ##es retained teeth in other parts of the jaws ) . eu ##orn ##ith ##es also included the first av ##ial ##ans to develop true p ##y ##gos ##tyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers , which may have replaced the " hind wing " as the primary mode of aerial maneuver ##ability and braking in flight .
allows more blood to be pumped [SEP] the av ##ian ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system is driven by a four - chamber ##ed , my ##ogenic heart contained in a fi ##bro ##us per ##ica ##rdial sac . this per ##ica ##rdial sac is filled with a ser ##ous fluid for lu ##bri ##cation . the heart itself is divided into a right and left half , each with an atrium and vent ##ric ##le . the atrium and vent ##ric ##les of each side are separated by at ##rio ##vent ##ric ##ular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction . being my ##ogenic , the heart ' s pace is maintained by pace ##maker cells found in the sino ##at ##rial node , located on the right atrium . the sino ##at ##rial node uses calcium to cause a de ##pol ##ari ##zing signal trans ##duction pathway from the atrium through right and left at ##rio ##vent ##ric ##ular bundle which communicate ##s contraction to the vent ##ric ##les . the av ##ian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers . much like a mammalian heart , the av ##ian heart is composed of end ##oca ##rdial , my ##oca ##rdial and epic ##ard ##ial layers . the atrium walls tend to be thinner than the vent ##ric ##le walls , due to the intense vent ##ric ##ular contraction used to pump oxygen ##ated blood throughout the body . av ##ian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass . this adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight .
to withstand the pressure of the vent ##ric ##ular con ##st ##ric ##tion [SEP] birds have a very efficient system for di ##ff ##using oxygen into the blood ; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals . as a result , birds have more blood in their cap ##illa ##ries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal . the arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the vent ##ric ##ular con ##st ##ric ##tion , and become more rigid as they move away from the heart . blood moves through the arteries , which undergo va ##so ##con ##st ##ric ##tion , and into arte ##rio ##les which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body . as the arte ##rio ##les move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow . travelling through the arte ##rio ##les blood moves into the cap ##illa ##ries where gas exchange can occur . cap ##illa ##ries are organized into cap ##illa ##ry beds in tissues , it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste . in the cap ##illa ##ry beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues . once the blood has become de ##ox ##y ##gen ##ated it travels through ve ##nu ##les then veins and back to the heart . veins , unlike arteries , are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure . as blood travels through the ve ##nu ##les to the veins a funnel ##ing occurs called va ##so ##di ##lation bringing blood back to the heart . once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium , then the right vent ##ric ##le to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen . oxygen ##ated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left vent ##ric ##le where it is pumped out to the body .
courtship [SEP] the nervous system is large relative to the bird ' s size . the most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight - related functions , while the ce ##re ##bell ##um coordinates movement and the ce ##re ##br ##um controls behaviour patterns , navigation , mating and nest building . most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including ki ##wi ##s , new world vulture ##s and tube ##nos ##es . the av ##ian visual system is usually highly developed . water birds have special flexible lenses , allowing accommodation for vision in air and water . some species also have dual f ##ove ##a . birds are te ##tra ##ch ##romatic , possessing ultraviolet ( uv ) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green , red and blue ones . this allows them to perceive ultraviolet light , which is involved in courtship . birds have specialized light - sensing cells deep in their brains that respond to light without input from eyes or other sensory neurons . these photo - rec ##eptive cells in the h ##yp ##oth ##ala ##mus are involved in detecting the longer days of spring , and thus regulate breeding activities .
because it lowers the loss of body heat [SEP] the high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times . sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vi ##gil ##ant sleep , where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye - opening " peek ##s " , allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats . swift ##s are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their ro ##ost ##ing flight . it has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight . some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow - wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time . the birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock . this may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vi ##gil ##ant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock . this adaptation is also known from marine mammals . communal ro ##ost ##ing is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators . ro ##ost ##ing sites are often chosen with regard to the ##rm ##ore ##gul ##ation and safety .
to ensure the parent ##age of the offspring that they raise [SEP] ninety - five percent of bird species are socially mono ##gam ##ous . these species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or — in some cases — for several years or until the death of one mate . mono ##gam ##y allows for both paternal care and bi ##par ##ental care , which is especially important for species in which females require males ' assistance for successful brood - rear ##ing . among many socially mono ##gam ##ous species , extra - pair cop ##ulation ( in ##fide ##lity ) is common . such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males , but may also be the result of forced cop ##ulation in ducks and other ana ##ti ##ds . female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after cop ##ulation , a hundred days in some species . sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism . for females , possible benefits of extra - pair cop ##ulation include getting better genes for her offspring and ins ##uring against the possibility of in ##fer ##tility in her mate . males of species that engage in extra - pair cop ##ulation ##s will closely guard their mates to ensure the parent ##age of the offspring that they raise .
because it leads to a reduction in pro ##geny fitness [SEP] cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring , usually males , delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin . female offspring rarely stay at home , di ##sper ##sing over distances that allow them to breed independently , or to join unrelated groups . in general , in ##bre ##eding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in pro ##geny fitness ( in ##bre ##eding depression ) due largely to the homo ##zy ##go ##us expression of del ##eter ##ious recess ##ive all ##eles . cross - fe ##rti ##lization between unrelated individuals or ##dina ##rily leads to the mask ##ing of del ##eter ##ious recess ##ive all ##eles in pro ##geny .
stabilize the regime and sped up the conquest of the rest of the country [SEP] first , the manchu ##s had entered " china proper " because do ##rgo ##n responded decisive ##ly to wu sang ##ui ' s appeal . then , after capturing beijing , instead of sack ##ing the city as the rebels had done , do ##rgo ##n insisted , over the protests of other manchu princes , on making it the d ##yna ##stic capital and re ##app ##oint ##ing most ming officials . choosing beijing as the capital had not been a straightforward decision , since no major chinese dynasty had directly taken over its immediate predecessor ' s capital . keeping the ming capital and bureaucracy intact helped quickly stabilize the regime and sped up the conquest of the rest of the country . however , not all of do ##rgo ##n ' s policies were equally popular nor easily implemented .
all three fi ##ef ##dom ##s to be reverted to the crown . [SEP] as the years went by , the three feudal lords and their extensive territories became increasingly autonomous . finally , in 167 ##3 , shang ke ##xi petitioned kang ##xi for permission to retire to his hometown in lia ##odon ##g province and nominated his son as his successor . the young emperor granted his retirement , but denied the here ##dity of his fi ##ef . in reaction , the two other generals decided to petition for their own retirement ##s to test kang ##xi ' s resolve , thinking that he would not risk off ##ending them . the move back ##fire ##d as the young emperor called their bluff by accepting their requests and ordering that all three fi ##ef ##dom ##s to be reverted to the crown .
crushed by the green standard army [SEP] the qing forces were crushed by wu from 167 ##3 - 167 ##4 . the qing had the support of the majority of han chinese soldiers and han elite against the three feud ##ator ##ies , since they refused to join wu sang ##ui in the revolt , while the eight banners and manchu officers fare ##d poorly against wu sang ##ui , so the qing responded with using a massive army of more than 900 , 000 han chinese ( non - banner ) instead of the eight banners , to fight and crush the three feud ##ator ##ies . wu sang ##ui ' s forces were crushed by the green standard army , made out of defected ming soldiers .
burnt it to the ground [SEP] ratification of the treaty the following year led to res ##ump ##tion of hostilities and in 1860 , with anglo - french forces marching on beijing , the emperor and his court fled the capital for the imperial hunting lodge at re ##he . once in beijing , the anglo - french forces looted the old summer palace , and in an act of revenge for the arrest of several english ##men , burnt it to the ground . prince gong , a younger half - brother of the emperor , who had been left as his brother ' s proxy in the capital , was forced to sign the convention of beijing . meanwhile , the humiliated emperor died the following year at re ##he .
evolved into an imperial chance ##ry [SEP] the formal structure of the qing government centered on the emperor as the absolute ruler , who presided over six boards ( ministries [ c ] ) , each headed by two presidents [ d ] and assisted by four vice presidents . [ e ] in contrast to the ming system , however , qing ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between manchu noble ##men and han officials who had passed the highest levels of the state examinations . the grand secretariat , [ f ] which had been an important policy - making body under the ming , lost its importance during the qing and evolved into an imperial chance ##ry . the institutions which had been inherited from the ming formed the core of the qing " outer court , " which handled routine matters and was located in the southern part of the forbidden city .
tai ##ping rebellion [SEP] early during the tai ##ping rebellion , qing forces suffered a series of disastrous defeats culminating in the loss of the regional capital city of nanjing in 1853 . shortly thereafter , a tai ##ping expeditionary force penetrated as far north as the suburbs of tianjin , the imperial heartland ##s . in desperation the qing court ordered a chinese official , zen ##g guo ##fan , to organize regional and village militias into an emergency army called tu ##an ##lian . zen ##g guo ##fan ' s strategy was to rely on local gentry to raise a new type of military organization from those provinces that the tai ##ping rebels directly threatened . this new force became known as the xiang army , named after the hunan region where it was raised . the xiang army was a hybrid of local militia and a standing army . it was given professional training , but was paid for out of regional co ##ffer ##s and funds its commanders — mostly members of the chinese gentry — could muster . the xiang army and its successor , the hua ##i army , created by zen ##g guo ##fan ' s colleague and men ##tee li hong ##zh ##ang , were collectively called the " yong ying " ( brave camp ) .
sacked [SEP] by the late 19th century , the most conservative elements within the qing court could no longer ignore china ' s military weakness . in 1860 , during the second opium war , the capital beijing was captured and the summer palace sacked by a relatively small anglo - french coalition force numbering 25 , 000 . the advent of modern weaponry resulting from the european industrial revolution had rendered china ' s traditionally trained and equipped army and navy obsolete . the government attempts to modern ##ize during the self - strengthening movement were initially successful , but yielded few lasting results because of the central government ' s lack of funds , lack of political will , and unwilling ##ness to depart from tradition .
population growth [SEP] the most significant fact of early and mid - qing social history was population growth . the population doubled during the 18th century . people in this period were also remarkably on the move . there is evidence suggesting that the empire ' s rapidly expanding population was geographically mobile on a scale , which , in term of its volume and its pro ##tracted and ro ##uti ##ni ##zed nature , was unprecedented in chinese history . indeed , the qing government did far more to encourage mobility than to discourage it . migration took several different forms , though might be divided in two varieties : permanent migration for reset ##tlement , and relocation conceived by the party ( in theory at least ) as a temporary so ##jou ##rn . parties to the latter would include the empire ' s increasingly large and mobile manual workforce , as well as its densely overlapping internal diaspora of local - origin - based merchant groups . it would also included the patterned movement of qing subjects overseas , largely to southeastern asia , in search of trade and other economic opportunities .
rise slowly and smoothly [SEP] the government broad ##ened land ownership by returning land that had been sold to large landowners in the late ming period by families unable to pay the land tax . to give people more incentives to participate in the market , they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late ming , and replaced the co ##r ##ve ##e system with a head tax used to hire laborers . the administration of the grand canal was made more efficient , and transport opened to private merchants . a system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages , and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century . wary of the power of wealthy merchants , qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines , except in poor areas . these restrictions on domestic resource exploration , as well as on foreign trade , are held by some scholars as a cause of the great diver ##gence , by which the western world overtook china economically .
lack of prior exposure [SEP] the european colonization of the americas forever changed the lives and cultures of the peoples of the continents . although the exact pre - contact population of the americas is unknown , scholars estimate that native american populations diminished by between 80 and 90 % within the first centuries of contact with europeans . the leading cause was disease . the continent was ravaged by epidemic ##s of diseases such as smallpox , me ##as ##les , and cholera , which were brought from europe by the early explorers and spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them . native americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases . the loss of lives was ex ##ace ##rba ##ted by conflict between colonists and indigenous people . colonists also frequently per ##pet ##rated massacre ##s on the indigenous groups and enslaved them . according to the u . s . bureau of the census ( 1894 ) , the north american indian wars of the 19th century cost the lives of about 19 , 000 whites and 30 , 000 native americans .
no immunity to european diseases [SEP] the first indigenous group encountered by columbus were the 250 , 000 tai ##nos of his ##pani ##ola who represented the dominant culture in the greater antilles and the bahamas . within thirty years about 70 % of the tai ##nos had died . they had no immunity to european diseases , so outbreak ##s of me ##as ##les and smallpox ravaged their population . increasing punishment of the tai ##nos for revolt ##ing against forced labour , despite measures put in place by the en ##com ##ien ##da , which included religious education and protection from warring tribes , eventually led to the last great tai ##no rebellion .
violent poison [SEP] following years of mist ##rea ##tment , the tai ##nos began to adopt suicidal behaviors , with women ab ##ort ##ing or killing their infants and men jumping from the cliffs or ing ##est ##ing un ##tre ##ated cass ##ava , a violent poison . eventually , a tai ##no ca ##ci ##que named en ##ri ##quil ##lo managed to hold out in the bao ##ru ##co mountain range for thirteen years , causing serious damage to the spanish , car ##ib - held plantations and their indian aux ##ilia ##ries . hearing of the seriousness of the revolt , emperor charles v ( also king of spain ) sent captain francisco barrio ##nu ##ev ##o to negotiate a peace treaty with the ever - increasing number of rebels . two months later , after consultation with the au ##den ##cia of santo domingo , en ##ri ##quil ##lo was offered any part of the island to live in peace .
too many artists were posing as native americans [SEP] visual arts by indigenous peoples of the americas comprise a major category in the world art collection . contributions include pottery , paintings , jewellery , weaving ##s , sculptures , basket ##ry , carvings , and bea ##d ##work . because too many artists were posing as native americans and alaska natives in order to profit from the cache of indigenous art in the united states , the u . s . passed the indian arts and crafts act of 1990 , requiring artists to prove that they are enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe . to support the ongoing practice of american indian , alaska native and native hawaiian arts and cultures in the united states , the ford foundation , arts advocates and american indian tribes created an endowment seed fund and established a national native arts and cultures foundation in 2007 .
groups are very small [SEP] most venezuelan ##s have some indigenous heritage , but the indigenous population make up only around 2 % of the total population . they speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects , but some of the ethnic groups are very small and their languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades . the most important indigenous groups are the ye ' ku ##ana , the way ##u ##u , the pe ##mon and the war ##ao . the most advanced native people to have lived in present - day venezuela is thought to have been the tim ##oto - cu ##ica ##s , who mainly lived in the venezuelan andes . in total it is estimated that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand inhabitants , the most densely populated area being the and ##ean region ( tim ##oto - cu ##ica ##s ) , thanks to the advanced agricultural techniques used .
out of prejudice and fear [SEP] the native american name controversy is an ongoing dispute over the acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the americas and to broad subset ##s thereof , such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes . when discussing broader subset ##s of peoples , naming may be based on shared language , region , or historical relationship . many english ex ##ony ##ms have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the americas . some of these names were based on foreign - language terms used by earlier explorers and colonists , while others resulted from the colonists ' attempt to translate end ##ony ##ms from the native language into their own , and yet others were pe ##jo ##rative terms arising out of prejudice and fear , during periods of conflict .
iron oxide [SEP] in nature , the red color of blood comes from hem ##og ##lo ##bin , the iron - containing protein found in the red blood cells of all ve ##rte ##brates . the red color of the grand canyon and other geological features is caused by hem ##ati ##te or red och ##re , both forms of iron oxide . it also causes the red color of the planet mars . the red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as ray ##leigh scattering , which , when the sun is low or below the horizon , increases the red - wavelength light that reaches the eye . the color of autumn leaves is caused by pigment ##s called ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns , which are produced towards the end of summer , when the green ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is no longer produced . one to two percent of the human population has red hair ; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment ph ##eo ##mel ##ani ##n ( which also accounts for the red color of the lips ) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eu ##mel ##ani ##n .
ray ##leigh scattering [SEP] in nature , the red color of blood comes from hem ##og ##lo ##bin , the iron - containing protein found in the red blood cells of all ve ##rte ##brates . the red color of the grand canyon and other geological features is caused by hem ##ati ##te or red och ##re , both forms of iron oxide . it also causes the red color of the planet mars . the red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as ray ##leigh scattering , which , when the sun is low or below the horizon , increases the red - wavelength light that reaches the eye . the color of autumn leaves is caused by pigment ##s called ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns , which are produced towards the end of summer , when the green ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is no longer produced . one to two percent of the human population has red hair ; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment ph ##eo ##mel ##ani ##n ( which also accounts for the red color of the lips ) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eu ##mel ##ani ##n .
phosphate [SEP] during the summer growing season , phosphate is at a high level . it has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugar ##s manufactured by ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l . but in the fall , phosphate , along with the other chemicals and nutrients , moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant . when this happens , the sugar - breakdown process changes , leading to the production of ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##n pigment ##s . the brighter the light during this period , the greater the production of ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns and the more brilliant the resulting color display . when the days of autumn are bright and cool , and the nights are chilly but not freezing , the brightest coloration ##s usually develop .
decreases performance [SEP] red is associated with dominance in a number of animal species . for example , in man ##dr ##ill ##s , red coloration of the face is greatest in alpha males , increasingly less prominent in lower ranking subordinate ##s , and directly correlated with levels of testosterone . red can also affect the perception of dominance by others , leading to significant differences in mortality , reproductive success and parental investment between individuals displaying red and those not . in humans , wearing red has been linked with increased performance in competitions , including professional sport and multiplayer video games . controlled tests have demonstrated that wearing red does not increase performance or levels of testosterone during exercise , so the effect is likely to be produced by perceived rather than actual performance . judges of tae kw ##on do have been shown to favor competitors wearing red protective gear over blue , and , when asked , a significant majority of people say that red abstract shapes are more " dominant " , " aggressive " , and " likely to win a physical competition " than blue shapes . in contrast to its positive effect in physical competition and dominance behavior , exposure to red decreases performance in cognitive tasks and eli ##cit ##s ave ##rs ##ion in psychological tests where subjects are placed in an " achievement " context ( e . g . taking an iq test ) .
to symbol ##ize the blood of christ and the christian martyrs [SEP] surveys show that red is the color most associated with courage . in western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice , particularly because of its association with blood . beginning in the middle ages , the pope and cardinals of the roman catholic church wore red to symbol ##ize the blood of christ and the christian martyrs . the banner of the christian soldiers in the first crusade was a red cross on a white field , the st . george ' s cross . according to christian tradition , saint george was a roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the emperor di ##oc ##let ##ian , who refused to reno ##unce his christian faith and was martyr ##ed . the saint george ' s cross became the flag of england in the 16th century , and now is part of the union flag of the united kingdom , as well as the flag of the republic of georgia .
to be visible from a distance in a crowd [SEP] red is used in modern fashion much as it was used in medieval painting ; to attract the eyes of the viewer to the person who is supposed to be the center of attention . people wearing red seem to be closer than those dressed in other colors , even if they are actually the same distance away . monarchs , wives of presidential candidates and other celebrities often wear red to be visible from a distance in a crowd . it is also commonly worn by life ##guard ##s and others whose job requires them to be easily found .
earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urban ##isation , organised religion and central government [SEP] egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern country , arising in the tenth millennium bc as one of the world ' s first nation states . considered a cradle of civil ##isation , ancient egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urban ##isation , organised religion and central government . iconic monuments such as the gi ##za nec ##ropolis and its great sphinx , as well the ruins of memphis , the ##bes , ka ##rna ##k , and the valley of the kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide . egypt ' s rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , having endured , and at times ass ##imi ##lated , various foreign influences , including greek , persian , roman , arab , ottoman , and european . although christian ##ised in the first century of the common era , it was subsequently islam ##ised due to the islamic conquest ##s of the seventh century .
to avoid distraction of their growth [SEP] muhammad ali pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the co ##r ##ve ##e to a great modern ##ised army . he introduced conscription of the male peasant ##ry in 19th century egypt , and took a novel approach to create his great army , strengthening it with numbers and in skill . education and training of the new soldiers was not an option ; the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation . the men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckon ##ed with . the resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold , one of nationalism and pride . it was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that muhammad ali imposed his rule over egypt .
cheaper than fully coloured work [SEP] there were two main techniques in greco - roman mosaic : opus ve ##rmi ##cula ##tum used tiny tess ##era ##e , typically cube ##s of 4 mill ##imeters or less , and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support . the tiny tess ##era ##e allowed very fine detail , and an approach to the illusion ##ism of painting . often small panels called emblem ##ata were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor - mosaic ##s in coarse ##r work . the normal technique was opus tess ##ella ##tum , using larger tess ##era ##e , which was laid on site . there was a distinct native italian style using black on a white background , which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work .
a landslide [SEP] the mosaic ##s of the villa roman ##a del casa ##le near piazza arm ##erina in sicily are the largest collection of late roman mosaic ##s in situ in the world , and are protected as a unesco world heritage site . the large villa rustic ##a , which was probably owned by emperor maxim ##ian , was built largely in the early 4th century . the mosaic ##s were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th century . the most important pieces are the circus scene , the 64 ##m long great hunting scene , the little hunt , the labour ##s of hercules and the famous bikini girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th century bikini ##s . the per ##ist ##yle , the imperial apartments and the the ##rma ##e were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaic ##s . other important examples of roman mosaic art in sicily were unearthed on the piazza vi ##tto ##ria in palermo where two houses were discovered . the most important scenes there depicted or ##pheus , alexander the great ' s hunt and the four seasons .
fulfillment of a vow [SEP] in the 5th - century raven ##na , the capital of the western roman empire , became the center of late roman mosaic art . the mausoleum of gall ##a pl ##ac ##idia was decorated with mosaic ##s of high artistic quality in 425 – 430 . the vaults of the small , cross - shaped structure are clad with mosaic ##s on blue background . the central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starr ##y sky . another great building established by gall ##a pl ##ac ##idia was the church of san giovanni evangelist ##a . she erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from constantinople to raven ##na . the mosaic ##s depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of raven ##na , peter ch ##rys ##olo ##gus . they are known only from renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
hidden behind mortar [SEP] very few early byzantine mosaic ##s survived the icon ##oc ##lastic destruction of the 8th century . among the rare examples are the 6th - century christ in majesty ( or ezekiel ' s vision ) mosaic in the ap ##se of the church of ho ##sio ##s david in thessaloniki that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times . nine mosaic panels in the ha ##gio ##s dem ##et ##rio ##s church , which were made between 63 ##4 and 730 , also escaped destruction . unusually almost all represent saint demetrius of thessaloniki , often with su ##pp ##lian ##ts before him .
condemned as idol ##at ##ry [SEP] in the icon ##oc ##lastic era , fig ##ural mosaic ##s were also condemned as idol ##at ##ry . the icon ##oc ##lastic churches were em ##bell ##ished with plain gold mosaic ##s with only one great cross in the ap ##se like the ha ##gia irene in constantinople ( after 740 ) . there were similar crosses in the ap ##ses of the ha ##gia sophia church in thessaloniki and in the church of the dorm ##ition in nic ##aea . the crosses were substituted with the image of the theo ##tok ##os in both churches after the victory of the icon ##od ##ules ( 78 ##7 – 79 ##7 and in 8th – 9th centuries respectively , the dorm ##ition church was totally destroyed in 1922 ) .
accidents of survival [SEP] there are very few existing mosaic ##s from the ko ##m ##nen ##ian period but this pau ##city must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression . the only surviving 12th - century mosaic work in constantinople is a panel in ha ##gia sophia depicting emperor john ii and empress e ##ire ##ne with the theo ##tok ##os ( 112 ##2 – 34 ) . the empress with her long braid ##ed hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing . it must be a life ##like portrayal because e ##ire ##ne was really a redhead as her original hungarian name , pi ##ros ##ka shows . the adjacent portrait of emperor alex ##ios i ko ##m ##nen ##os on a pier ( from 112 ##2 ) is similarly personal . the imperial mausoleum of the ko ##m ##nen ##os dynasty , the pan ##tok ##rator monastery was certainly decorated with great mosaic ##s but these were later destroyed . the lack of ko ##m ##nen ##ian mosaic ##s outside the capital is even more apparent . there is only a " communion of the apostles " in the ap ##se of the cathedral of ser ##res .
enhance the somewhat dubious legal ##ity of their rule [SEP] the hey ##day of mosaic making in sicily was the age of the independent norman kingdom in the 12th century . the norman kings adopted the byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legal ##ity of their rule . greek masters working in sicily developed their own style , that shows the influence of western european and islamic artistic tendencies . best examples of sicilian mosaic art are the cappella pal ##atin ##a of roger ii , the mart ##oran ##a church in palermo and the cathedral ##s of ce ##fa ##lu and mon ##real ##e .
a fire [SEP] the most important early islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the um ##ay ##yad mosque in damascus , then capital of the arab caliphate . the mosque was built between 70 ##6 and 71 ##5 . the caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the byzantine emperor to decorate the building . this is evidenced by the partly byzantine style of the decoration . the mosaic ##s of the inner courtyard depict paradise with beautiful trees , flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background . the mosaic ##s include no human figures , which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary byzantine works . the biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard , called the " bar ##ada panel " after the river bar ##ada . it is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world , at over 4 m2 . in 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively , and many mosaic ##s were lost , although some have been restored since .
gives the maker time to re ##work [SEP] the indirect method of applying tess ##era ##e is often used for very large projects , projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes . tiles are applied face - down to a backing paper using an ad ##hesive , and later transferred onto walls , floors or craft projects . this method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to re ##work areas , allows the cement ##ing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front , even when using tiles and pieces of differing thickness ##es . mosaic murals , benches and tablet ##ops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method , as it results in a smooth ##er and more even surface .
high cost of labor in developed countries [SEP] with high cost of labor in developed countries , production automation has become increasingly popular . rather than being assembled by hand , mosaic ##s designed using computer aided design ( cad ) software can be assembled by a robot . production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy . but these " computer " mosaic ##s have a different look than hand - made " art ##isan ##al " mosaic ##s . with robotic production , colored tiles are loaded into buffer ##s , and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software .
to satisfy a european thirst for knowledge [SEP] all over europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a european thirst for knowledge , and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions . princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends . the emergence of human ##ism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient greek texts .
increased [SEP] there are several major exceptions on tuition fees . in many european countries , it is possible to study without tuition fees . public universities in nordic countries were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005 . denmark , sweden and finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students . citizens of eu and ee ##a member states and citizens from switzerland remain exempt ##ed from tuition fees , and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact .
with ##held [SEP] extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice : in one of the many crises of the second pun ##ic war , jupiter capitol ##inus was promised every animal born that spring ( see ve ##r sac ##rum ) , to be rendered after five more years of protection from hannibal and his allies . the " contract " with jupiter is exceptionally detailed . all due care would be taken of the animals . if any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice , they would count as already sacrificed , since they had already been consecrated . normally , if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain , the offered sacrifice would be with ##held . in the imperial period , sacrifice was with ##held following tr ##ajan ' s death because the gods had not kept the emperor safe for the stipulated period . in po ##mp ##ei ##i , the genius of the living emperor was offered a bull : presumably a standard pr ##act ##ise in imperial cult , though minor offerings ( incense and wine ) were also made .
edict expired . [SEP] in the wake of religious riots in egypt , the emperor dec ##ius decreed that all subjects of the empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to " ancestral gods " or suffer a penalty : only jews were exempt . dec ##ius ' edict appealed to whatever common mo ##s mai ##ores might reunite a politically and socially fractured empire and its multitude of cult ##s ; no ancestral gods were specified by name . the fulfillment of sac ##ri ##fi ##cial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as roman . roman oath ##s of loyalty were traditionally collective ; the dec ##ian oath has been interpreted as a design to root out individual sub ##vers ##ives and suppress their cult ##s , but ap ##osta ##sy was sought , rather than capital punishment . a year after its due deadline , the edict expired .
rejected in a summary judgment [SEP] during the same court battle , via ##com won a court ruling requiring youtube to hand over 12 ter ##aby ##tes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site . the decision was criticized by the electronic frontier foundation , which called the court ruling " a set ##back to privacy rights " . in june 2010 , via ##com ' s lawsuit against google was rejected in a summary judgment , with u . s . federal judge louis l . stanton stating that google was protected by provisions of the digital millennium copyright act . via ##com announced its intention to appeal the ruling .
resolving lawsuits [SEP] in june 2007 , youtube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that in ##fr ##inge copyright . google ceo eric schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from via ##com , which alleged that youtube profit ##ed from content that it did not have the right to distribute . the system , which became known as content id , creates an id file for copyright ##ed audio and video material , and stores it in a database . when a video is uploaded , it is checked against the database , and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found .
were modified [SEP] an independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to youtube , and concluded that while the system was " surprisingly res ##ili ##ent " in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos , it was not in ##fall ##ible . the use of content id to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases , as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use . if a youtube user disagree ##s with a decision by content id , it is possible to fill in a form di ##sp ##uting the decision . youtube has cited the effectiveness of content id as one of the reasons why the site ' s rules were modified in december 2010 to allow some users to up ##load videos of unlimited length .
to launch the enhanced music experience [SEP] in may 2014 , prior to the launch of youtube ' s subscription - based music key service , the independent music trade organization worldwide independent network alleged that youtube was using non - ne ##go ##tia ##ble contracts with independent labels that were " under ##val ##ue ##d " in comparison to other streaming services , and that youtube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service . in a statement to the financial times in june 2014 , robert ky ##nc ##l confirmed that youtube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service " to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms . " stating that 90 % of labels had reached deals , he went on to say that " while we wish that we had [ a ] 100 % success rate , we understand that is not likely an ac ##hi ##eva ##ble goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience . " the financial times later reported that youtube had reached an aggregate deal with merlin network — a trade group representing over 20 , 000 independent labels , for their inclusion in the service . however , youtube itself has not confirmed the deal .
openly divine - right catholic , [SEP] the duke of york had required that every community in his new lands of new york and new jersey support some church , but this was more often dutch reformed , quaker or presbyterian , than anglican . some chose to support more than one church . he also ordained that the tax - pay ##ers were free , having paid his local tax , to choose their own church . the terms for the surrender of new amsterdam had provided that the dutch would have liberty of conscience , and the duke , as an openly divine - right catholic , was no friend of anglican ##ism . the first anglican minister in new jersey arrived in 169 ##8 , though anglican ##ism was more popular in new york .
to app ##ease the anti - federal ##ists [SEP] some legal scholars , such as john baker of lsu , theo ##rize that madison ' s initial proposed language — that congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a " national religion " — was rejected by the house , in favor of the more general " religion " in an effort to app ##ease the anti - federal ##ists . to both the anti - federal ##ists and the federal ##ists , the very word " national " was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the british crown . during the debate over the establishment clause , rep . el ##bridge gerry of massachusetts took issue with madison ' s language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government ( in which the states retained their individual sovereignty ) , which baker suggests compelled madison to withdraw his language from the debate .
because of the experience under the british crown [SEP] some legal scholars , such as john baker of lsu , theo ##rize that madison ' s initial proposed language — that congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a " national religion " — was rejected by the house , in favor of the more general " religion " in an effort to app ##ease the anti - federal ##ists . to both the anti - federal ##ists and the federal ##ists , the very word " national " was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the british crown . during the debate over the establishment clause , rep . el ##bridge gerry of massachusetts took issue with madison ' s language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government ( in which the states retained their individual sovereignty ) , which baker suggests compelled madison to withdraw his language from the debate .
constitution only gave congress stated powers [SEP] others , such as rep . roger sherman of connecticut , believed the clause was unnecessary because the original constitution only gave congress stated powers , which did not include establishing a national religion . anti - federal ##ists such as rep . thomas tucker of south carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could pre ##em ##pt the religious clauses in the state constitution ##s . however , the anti - federal ##ists were unsuccessful in per ##su ##ading the house of representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment .
procedural grounds [SEP] in 2002 , a three judge panel on the ninth circuit court of appeals held that classroom rec ##itation of the pledge of allegiance in a california public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to rec ##ite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under god . " in reaction to the case , elk grove unified school district v . new ##do ##w , both houses of congress passed measures re ##af ##firm ##ing their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel ' s ruling . the case was appealed to the supreme court , where the case was ultimately overturned in june 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . rather , a five - justice majority held that new ##do ##w , a non - cu ##sto ##dial parent sui ##ng on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
secular in nature [SEP] on december 20 , 2005 , the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit ruled in the case of ac ##lu v . mercer county that the continued display of the ten command ##ments as part of a larger display on american legal traditions in a kentucky courthouse was allowed , because the purpose of the display ( educating the public on american legal traditions ) was secular in nature . in ruling on the mount sole ##dad cross controversy on may 3 , 2006 , however , a federal judge ruled that the cross on public property on mount sole ##dad must be removed .
because it displayed no preference for a particular religion [SEP] relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches , the tax - free status of church property , the fact that christmas is a federal holiday , etc . , have also been questioned , but have been considered examples of the governmental pre ##ro ##gative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society . the national motto " in god we trust " has been challenged as a violation , but the supreme court has ruled that ceremonial dei ##sm is not religious in nature . a circuit court ruling affirmed ohio ' s right to use as its motto a passage from the bible , " with god , all things are possible " , because it displayed no preference for a particular religion .
the enlightenment [SEP] in europe , there has been a general move away from religious ob ##ser ##vance and belief in christian teachings and a move towards secular ##ism . the enlightenment is largely responsible for the spread of secular ##ism . several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secular ##ism and protestant ##ism , at ##tri ##bu ##ting it to the wide - ranging freedom in the protestant countries . in north america , south america and australia christian religious ob ##ser ##vance is much higher than in europe . united states remains particularly religious in comparison to other developed countries . south america , historically roman catholic , has experienced a large evangelical and pen ##tec ##ostal in ##fusion in the 20th and 21st centuries .
the lack of apostolic succession and the di ##sun ##ity from catholic church [SEP] a protestant baptism is held to be valid by the catholic church if given with the tri ##ni ##tarian formula and with the intent to ba ##pt ##ize . however , as the ordination of protestant ministers is not recognized due to the lack of apostolic succession and the di ##sun ##ity from catholic church , all other sacrament ##s ( except marriage ) performed by protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid . therefore , protestants des ##iring full communion with the catholic church are not re - baptized ( although they are confirmed ) and protestant ministers who become catholics may be ordained to the priesthood after a period of study .
strong thermal winds and great " cloud - streets " [SEP] brasil ##ia is known as a departing point for the practice of un ##powered air sports , sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or para ##gli ##ding wings . practitioners of such sports reveal that , because of the city ' s dry weather , the city offers strong thermal winds and great " cloud - streets " , which is also the name for a man ##oe ##u ##vre quite appreciated by practitioners . in 2003 , brasil ##ia hosted the 14th hang gliding world championship , one of the categories of free flying . in august 2005 , the city hosted the 2nd stage of the brazilian hang gliding championship .
not always evident who functioned as the opposition floor leader [SEP] to a large extent , the minority leader ' s position is a 20th - century innovation . prior to this time congressional parties were often relatively di ##sor ##gan ##ized , so it was not always evident who functioned as the opposition floor leader . decades went by before anything like the modern two - party congressional system emerged on capitol hill with official titles for those who were its official leaders . however , from the beginning days of congress , various house members intermittent ##ly assumed the role of " opposition leader . " some scholars suggest that representative james madison of virginia informally functioned as the first " minority leader " because in the first congress he led the opposition to treasury secretary alexander hamilton ' s fiscal policies .
ar ##bit ##rar ##ily handed out " choice jobs to close relatives . . . all at handsome salaries . [SEP] in the judgment of political scientist randall ripley , since 1883 " the candidate for speaker nominated by the minority party has clearly been the minority leader . " however , this assertion is subject to dispute . on december 3 , 1883 , the house elected democrat john g . carlisle of kentucky as speaker . republicans placed in nomination for the speakers ##hip j . warren kei ##fer of ohio , who was speaker the previous congress . clearly , kei ##fer was not the republicans ' minority leader . he was a disc ##red ##ited leader in part because as speaker he ar ##bit ##rar ##ily handed out " choice jobs to close relatives . . . all at handsome salaries . " kei ##fer received " the empty honor of the minority nomination . but with it came a sting - - for while this naturally involves the floor leadership , he was deserted by his [ partisan ] associates and his career as a national figure terminated ing ##lor ##iously . " representative thomas reed , r - me , who later became speaker , assumed the de facto role of minority floor leader in kei ##fer ' s ste ##ad . " [ a ] lt ##ho ##ugh kei ##fer was the minority ' s candidate for speaker , reed became its acknowledged leader , and ever after , so long as he served in the house , remained the most conspicuous member of his party .
object ##ing to their private bills on the floor [SEP] second , democrats have always elevated their minority floor leader to the speakers ##hip upon reclaim ##ing majority status . republicans have not always followed this leadership succession pattern . in 1919 , for instance , republicans bypassed james r . mann , r - il , who had been minority leader for eight years , and elected frederick gill ##ett , r - ma , to be speaker . mann " had angered many republicans by object ##ing to their private bills on the floor ; " also he was a protege of auto ##cratic speaker joseph cannon , r - il ( 1903 – 1911 ) , and many members " suspected that he would try to re - central ##ize power in his hands if elected speaker . " more recently , although robert h . michel was the minority leader in 1994 when the republicans regained control of the house in the 1994 mid ##ter ##m elections , he had already announced his retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign , including the contract with america which was unveiled six weeks before voting day .
the armenian genocide [SEP] armenians constitute the main population of armenia and the de facto independent na ##gor ##no - kara ##ba ##kh republic . there is a wide - ranging diaspora of around 5 million people of full or partial armenian ancestry living outside of modern armenia . the largest armenian populations today exist in russia , the united states , france , georgia , iran , ukraine , lebanon , and syria . with the exceptions of iran and the former soviet states , the present - day armenian diaspora was formed mainly as a result of the armenian genocide .
in defiance of the sas ##san ##ids [SEP] the ars ##ac ##id kingdom of armenia , itself a branch of the ars ##ac ##id dynasty of part ##hia , was the first state to adopt christianity as its religion ( it had formerly been adhere ##nt to armenian pagan ##ism , which was influenced by z ##oro ##ast ##rian ##ism , while later on adopting a few elements regarding identification of its pantheon with greco - roman deities ) . in the early years of the 4th century , likely ad 301 , partly in defiance of the sas ##san ##ids it seems . in the late part ##hian period , armenia was a predominantly z ##oro ##ast ##rian - ad ##hering land , but by the christian ##isation , previously predominant z ##oro ##ast ##rian ##ism and pagan ##ism in armenia gradually declined . later on , in order to further strengthen armenian national identity , me ##sr ##op mas ##ht ##ots invented the armenian alphabet , in 405 ad . this event ushered the golden age of armenia , during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to armenian by me ##sr ##op ' s pupils . armenia lost its sovereignty again in 42 ##8 ad to the rival ##ling byzantine and sas ##san ##id persian empires , until the muslim conquest of persia over ##ran also the regions in which armenians lived .
they consider to be un ##script ##ural doctrines [SEP] je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses are best known for their door - to - door preaching , distributing literature such as the watch ##tower and awake ! , and refusing military service and blood trans ##fusion ##s . they consider use of the name je ##ho ##vah vital for proper worship . they reject tri ##ni ##tarian ##ism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hell ##fire , which they consider to be un ##script ##ural doctrines . they do not observe christmas , easter , birthday ##s or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with christianity . adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as " the truth " and consider themselves to be " in the truth " . they consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of satan , and most limit their social interaction with non - witnesses . congregational disciplinary actions include di ##sf ##ello ##ws ##hip ##ping , their term for formal expulsion and shu ##nni ##ng . baptized individuals who formally leave are considered di ##sas ##so ##cia ##ted and are also shu ##nne ##d . di ##sf ##ello ##ws ##hip ##ped and di ##sas ##so ##cia ##ted individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed rep ##ent ##ant .
after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong [SEP] from 1966 , witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that christ ' s thousand - year reign might begin in late 1975 or shortly thereafter . the number of baptism ##s increased significantly , from about 59 , 000 in 1966 to more than 297 , 000 in 1974 . by 1975 , the number of active members exceeded two million . membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong . watch tower society literature did not state dog ##matic ##ally that 1975 would definitely mark the end , but in 1980 the watch tower society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year .
ousted from heaven [SEP] je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses believe that jesus christ began to rule in heaven as king of god ' s kingdom in october 1914 , and that satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in " wo ##e " to humanity . they believe that jesus rules in ##vis ##ibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of " signs " . they base this belief on a rendering of the greek word par ##ous ##ia — usually translated as " coming " when referring to christ — as " presence " . they believe jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . they thus depart from the mainstream christian belief that the " second coming " of matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans .
can only be one truth from god [SEP] je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses believe that the bible condemn ##s the mixing of religions , on the basis that there can only be one truth from god , and therefore reject inter ##fa ##ith and ecumenical movements . they believe that only their religion represents true christianity , and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by god and will soon be destroyed . je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain " separate from the world . " the witnesses ' literature defines the " world " as " the mass of mankind apart from je ##ho ##vah ' s approved servants " and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by satan . witnesses are taught that association with " world ##ly " people presents a " danger " to their faith , and are instructed to minimize social contact with non - members to better maintain their own standards of morality .
they consider to honor people other than jesus [SEP] je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses believe their highest allegiance belongs to god ' s kingdom , which is viewed as an actual government in heaven , with christ as king . they remain politically neutral , do not seek public office , and are discouraged from voting , though individual members may participate in un ##con ##tro ##vers ##ial community improvement issues . although they do not take part in politics , they respect the authority of the governments under which they live . they do not celebrate religious holidays such as christmas and easter , nor do they observe birthday ##s , nationalist ##ic holidays , or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than jesus . they feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalist ##ic or political spirit . their position is that these traditional holidays reflect satan ' s control over the world . witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthday ##s or other celebrations .
expelled and shu ##nne ##d [SEP] doctrines of je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses are established by the governing body . the religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion ' s teachings are expelled and shu ##nne ##d . witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the governing body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " god ' s organization " . it also warns members to " avoid independent thinking " , claiming such thinking " was introduced by satan the devil " and would " cause division " . those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " ap ##osta ##tes " who are " mentally disease ##d " .
to protect its " crime - free " reputation [SEP] the religion ' s failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized . the watch tower society ' s policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so , but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family . the australian royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse found that of 100 ##6 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses within their organization since 1950 , " not one was reported by the church to secular authorities . " william bowen , a former je ##ho ##vah ' s witness elder who established the silent ##lam ##bs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion , has claimed witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities , and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its " crime - free " reputation . in court cases in the united kingdom and the united states the watch tower society has been found to have been ne ##gli ##gent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court , reportedly paying as much as $ 780 , 000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrong ##do ##ing .
he re ##lent ##ed [SEP] he assumed duties again at camp meade , maryland , commanding a battalion of tanks , where he remained until 1922 . his schooling continued , focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it . his new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with george s . patton , ser ##eno e . brett , and other senior tank leaders . their leading - edge ideas of speed - oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors , who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry . eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment , and he re ##lent ##ed .
too old [SEP] as the election approached , other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged eisenhower to run for president . in january 1948 , after learning of plans in new hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming republican national convention , eisenhower stated through the army that he was " not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office " ; " life - long professional soldiers " , he wrote , " in the absence of some obvious and over ##riding reason , [ should ] abs ##tain from seeking high political office " . eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time . many believed he was for ##going his only opportunity to be president ; republican thomas e . dewey was considered the other probable winner , would presumably serve two terms , and eisenhower , at age 66 in 1956 , would then be too old .
iss ##uance of bonds to finance the project [SEP] eisenhower ' s goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the u . s . army ' s 1919 trans ##con ##tine ##ntal motor convoy . he was assigned as an observer for the mission , which involved sending a convoy of u . s . army vehicles coast to coast . his subsequent experience with encounter ##ing german auto ##bahn limited - access road systems during the concluding stages of world war ii convinced him of the benefits of an interstate highway system . noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country , he thought an interstate highway system in the u . s . would not only be beneficial for military operations , but provide a measure of continued economic growth . the legislation initially stalled in the congress over the iss ##uance of bonds to finance the project , but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by eisenhower in june 1956 .
beyond the constitutional authority of the executive branch [SEP] in 1953 , the republican party ' s old guard presented eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he di ##sa ##vo ##w the ya ##lta agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the executive branch ; however , the death of joseph stalin in march 1953 made the matter a practical mo ##ot point . at this time eisenhower gave his chance for peace speech in which he attempted , unsuccessfully , to forest ##all the nuclear arms race with the soviet union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials . biographer stephen ambrose opined that this was the best speech of eisenhower ' s presidency .
refusal of the russians to permit any sort of inspections [SEP] in 1955 american nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to di ##sar ##mament . the failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the russians to permit any sort of inspections . in talks located in london that year , they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections ; the tables were then turned on eisenhower , when he responded with an unwilling ##ness on the part of the u . s . to permit inspections . in may of that year the russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to austria , and paved the way for a geneva summit with the u . s . , u . k . and france . at the geneva conference eisenhower presented a proposal called " open skies " to facilitate di ##sar ##mament , which included plans for russia and the u . s . to provide mutual access to each other ' s skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure . russian leader nikita k ##hr ##ush ##chev dismissed the proposal out of hand .
soviet launch of sp ##ut ##nik [SEP] on the whole , eisenhower ' s support of the nation ' s fledgling space program was officially modest until the soviet launch of sp ##ut ##nik in 1957 , gaining the cold war enemy enormous prestige around the world . he then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education . his open skies policy attempted to leg ##iti ##mi ##ze illegal lockheed u - 2 fly ##overs and project gene ##trix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory , created nasa as a civilian space agency , signed a landmark science education law , and foster ##ed improved relations with american scientists .
trial [SEP] soviet premier nikita k ##hr ##ush ##chev announced that a " spy - plane " had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot . as a result , the eisenhower administration , thinking the pilot had died in the crash , authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a " weather research aircraft " which had un ##int ##ent ##ional ##ly stray ##ed into soviet airspace after the pilot had radio ##ed " difficulties with his oxygen equipment " while flying over turkey . the soviets put captain powers on trial and displayed parts of the u - 2 , which had been recovered almost fully intact .
facilitate relations with congress [SEP] this prevented eisenhower from openly condemning joseph mccarthy ' s highly criticized methods against communism . to facilitate relations with congress , eisenhower decided to ignore mccarthy ' s controversies and thereby de ##pr ##ive them of more energy from involvement of the white house . this position drew criticism from a number of corners . in late 1953 mccarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the 1954 senate elections . eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists . nevertheless , he refused .
left vent ##ric ##ular an ##eur ##ys ##m [SEP] as a consequence of his heart attack , eisenhower developed a left vent ##ric ##ular an ##eur ##ys ##m , which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on november 25 , 1957 . this incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand . the stroke had caused an ap ##has ##ia . the president also suffered from cr ##oh ##n ' s disease , chronic inflammatory condition of the int ##est ##ine , which necessitated surgery for a bow ##el obstruction on june 9 , 1956 . to treat the int ##estinal block , surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small int ##est ##ine . his scheduled meeting with indian prime minister jaw ##aha ##rl ##al nehru was postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm in gettysburg , pennsylvania . he was still recovering from this operation during the suez crisis . eisenhower ' s health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits , but he still ind ##ul ##ged in alcohol . during a visit to england he complained of di ##zziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on august 29 , 1959 ; however , before dinner at che ##que ##rs on the next day his doctor general howard snyder recalled eisenhower " drank several gin - and - tonic ##s , and one or two gin ##s on the rocks . . . three or four wines with the dinner " .

toll ##s were resented [SEP] the development of the bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between new england and new york ( manhattan ) . control over the bridges across the harlem river plagued the period of british colonial rule . kings ##bridge , built in 169 ##3 where broadway reached the sp ##uy ##ten du ##y ##vil creek , was a possession of frederick philips ##e , lord of philips ##e manor . the toll ##s were resented by local farmers on both sides of the creek . in 1759 , the farmers led by jacob ##us d ##yck ##man and benjamin palmer built a " free bridge " across the harlem river which led to the abandonment of toll ##s altogether .
it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to ref ##ur ##bis ##h or sell a building in a severely distressed area [SEP] in the 1970s , the bronx was plagued by a wave of arson . the burning of buildings was predominantly in the poor ##est communities , like the south bronx . the most common explanation of what occurred was that landlord ##s decided to burn their low property - value buildings and take the insurance money as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to ref ##ur ##bis ##h or sell a building in a severely distressed area . the bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment , which was mainly a persistent problem in the south bronx .
the name has been used to represent poverty in the bronx and applied to progressively more northern places [SEP] like other neighborhoods in new york city , the south bronx has no official boundaries . the name has been used to represent poverty in the bronx and applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s fordham road was often used as a northern limit . the bronx river more consistently forms an eastern boundary . the south bronx has many high - density apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , and multi - unit homes . the south bronx is home to the bronx county courthouse , borough hall , and other government buildings , as well as yankee stadium . the cross bronx expressway bis ##ect ##s it , east to west . the south bronx has some of the poor ##est neighborhoods in the country , as well as very high crime areas .
brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the board than staten island , the least populous borough [SEP] the office of borough president was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance central ##ization with local authority . each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the new york city board of estimate , which was responsible for creating and app ##roving the city ' s budget and proposals for land use . in 1989 the supreme court of the united states declared the board of estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the board than staten island , the least populous borough , a violation of the fourteenth amendment ' s equal protection clause pursuant to the high court ' s 1964 " one man , one vote " decision .
for his editorial ##s about bronx and new york city issues [SEP] the bronx has several local newspapers , including the bronx news , park ##chester news , city news , the river ##dale press , river ##dale review , the bronx times reporter , inner city press ( which now has more of a focus on national issues ) and co - op city times . four non - profit news outlets , norwood news , mount hope monitor , mo ##tt haven herald and the hunts point express serve the borough ' s poorer communities . the editor and co - publisher of the river ##dale press , bernard stein , won the pulitzer prize for editorial writing for his editorial ##s about bronx and new york city issues in 1998 . ( stein graduated from the bronx high school of science in 1959 . )
tough competition [SEP] during a period of tough competition between mortgage lend ##ers for revenue and market share , and when the supply of credit ##worthy borrow ##ers was limited , mortgage lend ##ers relaxed under ##writing standards and originated risk ##ier mortgage ##s to less credit ##worthy borrow ##ers . in the view of some analysts , the relatively conservative government - sponsored enterprises ( gs ##es ) police ##d mortgage origin ##ators and maintained relatively high under ##writing standards prior to 2003 . however , as market power shifted from sec ##uri ##ti ##zers to origin ##ators and as intense competition from private sec ##uri ##ti ##zers undermine ##d gs ##e power , mortgage standards declined and risky loans pro ##life ##rated . the worst loans were originated in 2004 – 2007 , the years of the most intense competition between sec ##uri ##ti ##zers and the lowest market share for the gs ##es .
disappeared [SEP] country ##wide , sued by california attorney general jerry brown for " unfair business practices " and " false advertising " was making high cost mortgage ##s " to home ##own ##ers with weak credit , adjustable rate mortgage ##s ( arms ) that allowed home ##own ##ers to make interest - only payments " . when housing prices decreased , home ##own ##ers in arms then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments , since their home equity had disappeared . this caused country ##wide ' s financial condition to deter ##ior ##ate , ultimately resulting in a decision by the office of th ##rift supervision to seize the lend ##er .
we were in a recession [SEP] during april 2009 , u . s . federal reserve vice - chair janet yell ##en discussed these paradox ##es : " once this massive credit crunch hit , it didn ’ t take long before we were in a recession . the recession , in turn , deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell , and credit losses of financial institutions surged . indeed , we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year . a process of balance sheet del ##ever ##aging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy . consumers are pulling back on purchases , especially on durable goods , to build their savings . businesses are cancel ##ling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash . and , financial institutions are shrinking assets to bo ##lster capital and improve their chances of weather ##ing the current storm . once again , minsk ##y understood this dynamic . he spoke of the paradox of del ##ever ##aging , in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms — and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state — nevertheless mag ##ni ##fy the distress of the economy as a whole . "
expanded dramatically [SEP] the term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives , such as offset ##ting a particular risk exposure ( such as the default of a borrow ##er ) or to assist with obtaining financing . examples per ##tine ##nt to this crisis included : the adjustable - rate mortgage ; the bun ##dling of sub ##pr ##ime mortgage ##s into mortgage - backed securities ( mb ##s ) or collateral ##ized debt obligations ( cd ##o ) for sale to investors , a type of sec ##uri ##ti ##zation ; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swap ##s ( cds ) . the usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis . these products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions .
more complex [SEP] as financial assets became more and more complex , and harder and harder to value , investors were reassured by the fact that both the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators , who came to rely on them , accepted as valid some complex mathematical models which theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they actually proved to be . george so ##ros commented that " the super - boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves . similarly , the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the origin ##ators of synthetic products . it was a shocking abd ##ication of responsibility . "
d ##yna ##stic divisions of inheritance among the kings offspring [SEP] after annex ##ing the county of portugal into one of the several counties that made up the kingdom of asturias , king alfonso iii of asturias knighted vi ##mara pere ##s , in 86 ##8 ad , as the first count of port ##us cale ( portugal ) . the region became known as port ##uca ##le , portugal ##e , and simultaneously portugal ##ia — the county of portugal . later the kingdom of asturias was divided into a number of christian kingdoms in northern spain due to d ##yna ##stic divisions of inheritance among the kings offspring . with the forced abd ##ication of alfonso iii " the great " of asturias by his sons in 910 , the kingdom of asturias split into three separate kingdoms of leon , galicia and asturias . the three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 92 ##4 ( leon and galicia in 91 ##4 , asturias later ) under the crown of leon .
to ensure the wine ' s quality [SEP] but se ##bas ##tia ##o de mel ##o ' s greatest reforms were economic and financial , with the creation of several companies and guild ##s to regulate every commercial activity . he dem ##ar ##cated the region for production of port to ensure the wine ' s quality , and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in europe . he ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of portuguese society from the high nobility to the poor ##est working class , along with a widespread review of the country ' s tax system . these reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes , especially among the high nobility , who despised him as a social ups ##tar ##t .
wounded in an attempted assassination [SEP] following the earthquake , joseph i gave his prime minister even more power , and se ##bas ##tia ##o de mel ##o became a powerful , progressive dictator . as his power grew , his enemies increased in number , and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent . in 1758 joseph i was wounded in an attempted assassination . the ta ##vor ##a family and the duke of ave ##iro were implicated and executed after a quick trial . the jesuits were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown . se ##bas ##tia ##o de mel ##o prosecuted every person involved , even women and children . this was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy . joseph i made his loyal minister count of o ##eira ##s in 1759 .
to protect the centuries - long portuguese interests in the continent from rival ##ries en ##tic ##ed by the scramble for africa [SEP] with the conference of berlin of 1884 , portuguese africa territories had their borders formally established on request of portugal in order to protect the centuries - long portuguese interests in the continent from rival ##ries en ##tic ##ed by the scramble for africa . portuguese africa ' s cities and towns like nova li ##sb ##oa , sa da band ##eira , silva porto , mala ##n ##je , te ##te , vila jun ##que ##iro , vila per ##y and vila cab ##ral were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond . new coastal towns like bei ##ra , mo ##cam ##edes , lo ##bit ##o , joao bel ##o , na ##cala and porto amelia were also founded . even before the turn of the 20th century , railway tracks as the ben ##gue ##la railway in angola , and the bei ##ra railway in mozambique , started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions .
because of habitat loss , pollution and drought [SEP] there are more than 100 freshwater fish species , varying from the giant european catfish ( in the tag ##us international natural park ) to some small and endemic species that live only in small lakes ( along the western portion of country , for example ) . some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss , pollution and drought . up - well ##ing along the west coast of portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish ; the portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world . marine fish species are more common , and include thousands of species , such as the sar ##dine ( sar ##dina pi ##lch ##ard ##us ) , tuna and atlantic mack ##ere ##l . bio ##lum ##ines ##cent species are also well represented ( including species in different colour spectrum and forms ) , like the glowing plank ##ton that are possible to observe in some beaches .
bad investments , em ##be ##zzle ##ment and accounting fraud [SEP] after the financial crisis of 2007 – 08 , it was known in 2008 – 2009 that two portuguese banks ( banco port ##ug ##ues de ne ##go ##cio ##s ( bp ##n ) and banco pri ##va ##do port ##ug ##ues ( bp ##p ) ) had been acc ##um ##ulating losses for years due to bad investments , em ##be ##zzle ##ment and accounting fraud . the case of bp ##n was particularly serious because of its size , market share , and the political implications - portugal ' s then current president , ca ##vac ##o silva , and some of his political allies , maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its ceo , who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes . in the grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the portuguese economy , the portuguese government decided to give them a bail ##out , eventually at a future loss to taxpayers and to the portuguese people in general .
its size , market share , and the political implications [SEP] after the financial crisis of 2007 – 08 , it was known in 2008 – 2009 that two portuguese banks ( banco port ##ug ##ues de ne ##go ##cio ##s ( bp ##n ) and banco pri ##va ##do port ##ug ##ues ( bp ##p ) ) had been acc ##um ##ulating losses for years due to bad investments , em ##be ##zzle ##ment and accounting fraud . the case of bp ##n was particularly serious because of its size , market share , and the political implications - portugal ' s then current president , ca ##vac ##o silva , and some of his political allies , maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its ceo , who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes . in the grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the portuguese economy , the portuguese government decided to give them a bail ##out , eventually at a future loss to taxpayers and to the portuguese people in general .
geographical position [SEP] continental portugal ' s 89 , 01 ##5 km ##2 ( 34 , 36 ##9 sq mi ) territory is serviced by four international airports located near the principal cities of lisbon , porto , far ##o and be ##ja . lisbon ' s geographical position makes it a stop ##over for many foreign airlines at several airports within the country . the primary flag - carrier is tap portugal , although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country . the government decided to build a new airport outside lisbon , in al ##co ##chet ##e , to replace lisbon porte ##la airport , though this plan has been stalled due to the aus ##ter ##ity . currently , the most important airports are in lisbon , porto , far ##o , fun ##chal ( madeira ) , and pont ##a del ##ga ##da ( azores ) , managed by the national airport authority group ana – aero ##port ##os de portugal .
in order to create an empire which would carry his name to unknown lands [SEP] within the white in ##escu ##tch ##eon , the five qui ##nas ( small blue shields ) with their five white be ##zan ##ts representing the five wounds of christ ( portuguese : ci ##nco cha ##gas ) when cr ##uc ##ified and are popularly associated with the " miracle of our ##ique " . the story associated with this miracle tells that before the battle of our ##ique ( 25 july 113 ##9 ) , an old hermit appeared before count af ##ons ##o henri ##ques ( future af ##ons ##o i ) as a divine messenger . he fore ##to ##ld af ##ons ##o ' s victory and assured him that god was watching over him and his peers . the messenger advised him to walk away from his camp , alone , if he heard a nearby chapel bell toll ##ing , in the following night . in doing so , he witnessed an app ##ari ##tion of jesus on the cross . ec ##static , af ##ons ##o heard jesus promising victories for the coming battles , as well as god ' s wish to act through af ##ons ##o , and his descendants , in order to create an empire which would carry his name to unknown lands , thus choosing the portuguese to perform great tasks .
greek manuscripts [SEP] the humanist ##s ' close study of latin literary texts soon enabled them to disc ##ern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods . by analogy with what they saw as decline of latin , they applied the principle of ad font ##es , or back to the sources , across broad areas of learning , seeking out manuscripts of pat ##rist ##ic literature as well as pagan authors . in 143 ##9 , while employed in naples at the court of alfonso v of aragon ( at the time engaged in a dispute with the papal states ) the humanist lorenzo val ##la used stylistic textual analysis , now called philology , to prove that the donation of constantine , which purported to con ##fer temporal powers on the pope of rome , was an 8th - century forge ##ry . for the next 70 years , however , neither val ##la nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way . instead , after the fall of the byzantine empire to the turks in 145 ##3 , which brought a flood of greek orthodox refugees to italy , humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of neo ##pl ##aton ##ism and her ##met ##ici ##sm , hoping to bridge the differences between the greek and roman churches , and even between christianity itself and the non - christian world . the refugees brought with them greek manuscripts , not only of plato and aristotle , but also of the christian gospels , previously unavailable in the latin west .
because of the mia ##sma theory of disease ; thus , cemeteries were moved out of town , etc . [SEP] as conceptual ##ized by the pol ##ize ##i ##wi ##ssen ##schaft , according to f ##ou ##ca ##ult the police had an administrative , economic and social duty ( " pro ##cu ##ring abundance " ) . it was in charge of demographic concerns and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of rai ##son d ' etat and therefore giving the superficial appearance of em ##powering the population ( and un ##wi ##tting ##ly supervising the population ) , which , according to mer ##can ##ti ##list theory , was to be the main strength of the state . thus , its functions largely over ##rea ##ched simple law enforcement activities and included public health concerns , urban planning ( which was important because of the mia ##sma theory of disease ; thus , cemeteries were moved out of town , etc . ) , and surveillance of prices .
this is a secretive area and one not open to civil society involvement [SEP] perhaps the greatest question regarding the future development of trans ##national policing is : in whose interest is it ? at a more practical level , the question translates into one about how to make trans ##national policing institutions democratic ##ally accountable ( she ##pt ##yck ##i , 2004 ) . for example , according to the global accountability report for 2007 ( lloyd , et al . 2007 ) inter ##pol had the lowest scores in its category ( i ##gos ) , coming in tenth with a score of 22 % on overall accountability capabilities ( p . 19 ) . as this report points out , and the existing academic literature on trans ##national policing seems to confirm , this is a secretive area and one not open to civil society involvement .
to co - or ##dina ##te their work , share information , and get help quickly [SEP] modern police forces make extensive use of radio communications equipment , carried both on the person and installed in vehicles , to co - or ##dina ##te their work , share information , and get help quickly . in recent years , vehicle - installed computers have enhanced the ability of police communications , enabling easier dispatch ##ing of calls , criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds , and up ##dating officers ' daily activity log and other , required reports on a real - time basis . other common pieces of police equipment include flashlight ##s / torches , whistle ##s , police notebook ##s and " ticket books " or citations .
it endangered motor ##ists who might be pulled over by people imp ##erson ##ating police officers [SEP] unmarked vehicles are used primarily for sting operations or app ##re ##hend ##ing criminals without alert ##ing them to their presence . some police forces use unmarked or minimal ##ly marked cars for traffic law enforcement , since drivers slow down at the sight of marked police vehicles and unmarked vehicles make it easier for officers to catch speed ##ers and traffic viola ##tors . this practice is controversial , with for example , new york state banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motor ##ists who might be pulled over by people imp ##erson ##ating police officers .
they allow for more open interaction with the public [SEP] motorcycles are also commonly used , particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach , to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motor ##cy ##cl ##ists and often in escort duties where motorcycle police officers can quickly clear a path for escorted vehicles . bicycle patrols are used in some areas because they allow for more open interaction with the public . in addition , their quieter operation can facilitate approaching suspects unaware ##s and can help in pursuing them attempting to escape on foot .
to reduce their vulnerability to corruption [SEP] in the united states , august vol ##lmer introduced other reforms , including education requirements for police officers . o . w . wilson , a student of vol ##lmer , helped reduce corruption and introduce professional ##ism in wichita , kansas , and later in the chicago police department . strategies employed by o . w . wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption , establishing of a non - partisan police board to help govern the police force , a strict merit system for promotions within the department , and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers . during the professional ##ism era of policing , law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with fe ##lon ##ies and other serious crime , rather than broader focus on crime prevention .
to ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular compete ##ncies of the courts of law [SEP] in contrast , the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions . to ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular compete ##ncies of the courts of law , some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts cannot be obtained in time , and where , without interference of the police , the realization of the private right would be imp ##eded . this would , for example , allow police to establish a restaurant guest ' s identity and forward it to the inn ##keeper in a case where the guest cannot pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table .
because the term is " em ##bro ##iled in twentieth - century political disputes about whether turkic or iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of central asia . " [SEP] tajikistan means the " land of the ta ##ji ##ks " . the suffix " - stan " ( persian : ـ ##س ##ت ##ان - stan ) is persian for " place of " or " country " and ta ##ji ##k is , most likely , the name of a pre - islamic ( before the seventh century a . d . ) tribe . according to the library of congress ' s 1997 country study of tajikistan , it is difficult to definitive ##ly state the origins of the word " ta ##ji ##k " because the term is " em ##bro ##iled in twentieth - century political disputes about whether turkic or iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of central asia . "
the threat of forced conscription during world war i [SEP] during the late 19th century the ja ##di ##dis ##ts established themselves as an islamic social movement throughout the region . although the ja ##di ##dis ##ts were pro - modernization and not necessarily anti - russian the russians viewed the movement as a threat .

because of persecution , increased poverty and better economic opportunities [SEP] the nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another ; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyal ##ties . more than 500 , 000 residents fled during this time because of persecution , increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the west or in other former soviet republics . em ##oma ##li ra ##hm ##on came to power in 1992 , defeating former prime minister abd ##uma ##lik abdul ##la ##jan ##ov in a november presidential election with 58 % of the vote . the elections took place shortly after the end of the war , and tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation . the estimated dead numbered over 100 , 000 . around 1 . 2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country . in 1997 , a ceasefire was reached between ra ##hm ##on and opposition parties under the guidance of ge ##rd d . mer ##rem , special representative to the secretary general , a result widely praised as a successful united nations peace keeping initiative . the ceasefire guaranteed 30 % of ministerial positions would go to the opposition . elections were held in 1999 , though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and ra ##hm ##on was re - elected with 98 % of the vote . elections in 2006 were again won by ra ##hm ##on ( with 79 % of the vote ) and he began his third term in office . several opposition parties boycott ##ed the 2006 election and the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( os ##ce ) criticized it , although observers from the commonwealth of independent states claimed the elections were legal and transparent . ra ##hm ##on ' s administration came under further criticism from the os ##ce in october 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media . the os ##ce claimed that the ta ##ji ##k government ce ##nsor ##ed ta ##ji ##k and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the ce ##ssa ##tion of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers .
to conduct joint training missions of up to several weeks duration . [SEP] russian border troops were stationed along the ta ##ji ##k – afghan border until summer 2005 . since the september 11 , 2001 attacks , french troops have been stationed at the du ##shan ##be airport in support of air operations of nato ' s international security assistance force in afghanistan . united states army and marine corps personnel periodically visit tajikistan to conduct joint training missions of up to several weeks duration . the government of india rebuilt the a ##yn ##i air base , a military airport located 15 km southwest of du ##shan ##be , at a cost of $ 70 million , completing the repairs in september 2010 . it is now the main base of the tajikistan air force . there have been talks with russia concerning use of the a ##yn ##i facility , and russia continues to maintain a large base on the outskirts of du ##shan ##be .
that islamic mil ##ita ##ris ##m in the east of the country was on the rise following the escape of 25 militants from a ta ##ji ##k prison in august [SEP] in 2010 , there were concerns among ta ##ji ##k officials that islamic mil ##ita ##ris ##m in the east of the country was on the rise following the escape of 25 militants from a ta ##ji ##k prison in august , an ambush that killed 28 ta ##ji ##k soldiers in the rash ##t valley in september , and another ambush in the valley in october that killed 30 soldiers , followed by fighting outside g ##har ##m that left 3 militants dead . to date the country ' s interior ministry asserts that the central government maintains full control over the country ' s east , and the military operation in the rash ##t valley was concluded in november 2010 . however , fighting erupted again in july 2012 . in 2015 russia will send more troops to tajikistan , as confirmed by a report of st ##rat ##for ( magazine online )
accusations from opposition parties and international observers that president em ##oma ##li ##i ra ##hm ##on corrupt ##ly manipulate ##s the election process and unemployment [SEP] the parliamentary elections of 2005 aroused many accusations from opposition parties and international observers that president em ##oma ##li ##i ra ##hm ##on corrupt ##ly manipulate ##s the election process and unemployment . the most recent elections , in february 2010 , saw the ruling pd ##pt lose four seats in parliament , yet still maintain a comfortable majority . the organization for security and co - operation in europe election observers said the 2010 polling " failed to meet many key os ##ce commitments " and that " these elections failed on many basic democratic standards . " the government insisted that only minor violations had occurred , which would not affect the will of the ta ##ji ##k people .

its fighting irish football team [SEP] notre dame rose to national prominence in the early 1900s for its fighting irish football team , especially under the guidance of the legendary coach kn ##ute rock ##ne . the university ' s athletic teams are members of the ncaa division i and are known collectively as the fighting irish . the football team , an independent , has accumulated eleven consensus national championships , seven he ##isman trophy winners , 62 members in the college football hall of fame and 13 members in the pro football hall of fame and is considered one of the most famed and successful college football teams in history . other n ##d teams , chiefly in the atlantic coast conference , have accumulated 16 national championships . the notre dame victory march is often regarded as the most famous and recognizable collegiate fight song .
the rise of hitler and other dictator ##s [SEP] the rise of hitler and other dictator ##s in the 1930s forced numerous catholic intellectuals to flee europe ; president john o ' hara brought many to notre dame . from germany came anton - hermann ch ##rous ##t ( 1907 – 1982 ) in classics and law , and wal ##de ##mar gu ##rian a german catholic intellectual of jewish descent . po ##sit ##ivism dominated american intellectual life in the 1920s onward but in marked contrast , gu ##rian received a german catholic education and wrote his doctoral dissertation under max sc ##hel ##er . ivan me ##st ##rov ##ic ( 1883 – 1962 ) , a renowned sculptor , brought croatian culture to campus , 1955 – 62 . yves simon ( 1903 – 61 ) , brought to n ##d in the 1940s the insights of french studies in the ari ##sto ##tel ##ian - thom ##istic tradition of philosophy ; his own teacher jacques mari ##tain ( 1882 – 73 ) was a frequent visitor to campus .
depth of an anthropological approach [SEP] ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide , infant ##icide , racism , mu ##tila ##tion ( including ci ##rc ##um ##cision and sub ##in ##cision ) , and torture . topics like racism , slavery , and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional def ##iciencies to genes to acc ##ult ##uration have been proposed , not to mention theories of colonial ##ism and many others as root causes of man ' s inhuman ##ity to man . to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach , one can take just one of these topics , such as " racism " and find thousands of anthropological references , stretching across all the major and minor sub - fields .
communist sy ##mp ##athi ##es . [SEP] but by the 1940s , many of bo ##as ' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the " axis " ( nazi germany , fascist italy , and imperial japan ) . many served in the armed forces , while others worked in intelligence ( for example , office of strategic services and the office of war information ) . at the same time , david h . price ' s work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologist ##s from their jobs for communist sy ##mp ##athi ##es .
bid for statehood [SEP] under territorial governor thomas me ##agh ##er , montana ##ns held a constitutional convention in 1866 in a failed bid for statehood . a second constitutional convention was held in helena in 1884 that produced a constitution ratified 3 : 1 by montana citizens in november 1884 . for political reasons , congress did not approve montana statehood until 1889 . congress approved montana statehood in february 1889 and president grover cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting statehood to montana , north dakota , south dakota and washington once the appropriate state constitution ##s were crafted . in july 1889 , montana ##ns convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution acceptable by the people and the federal government . on november 8 , 1889 president benjamin harrison proclaimed montana the forty - first state in the union . the first state governor was joseph k . tool ##e . in the 1880s , helena ( the current state capital ) had more millionaire ##s per capita than any other united states city .
sports , exhibitions , and livestock competitions [SEP] exhibitions and annual horse shows in all districts and a national horse and cattle show at lahore are held with the official patronage . the national horse and cattle show at lahore is the biggest festival where sports , exhibitions , and livestock competitions are held . it not only encourages and patron ##ises agricultural products and livestock through the exhibitions of agricultural products and cattle but is also a colourful documentary on the rich cultural heritage of the province with its strong rural roots .
track layout [SEP] the richmond area also has two railroad stations served by amtrak . each station receives regular service from north of richmond including washington , d . c . , philadelphia , and new york . the suburban staples mill road station is located on a major north - south freight line and receives all service to and from all points south including , raleigh , durham , savannah , newport news , williamsburg and florida . richmond ' s only railway station located within the city limits , the historic main street station , was renovated in 2004 . as of 2010 , the station only receives trains headed to and from newport news and williamsburg due to track layout . as a result , the staples mill road station receives more trains and serves more passengers overall .
because it is normal to have bacterial colonization [SEP] because it is normal to have bacterial colonization , it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected . despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice , there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs . a review of chronic wounds in the journal of the american medical association ' s " rational clinical examination series " quan ##ti ##fied the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection . the review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [ likelihood ratio ( l ##r ) range , 11 - 20 ] makes infection much more likely , but the absence of pain ( negative likelihood ratio range , 0 . 64 - 0 . 88 ) does not rule out infection ( summary l ##r 0 . 64 - 0 . 88 ) .
body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection [SEP] persistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection . persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism , often as late ##nt infection with occasional rec ##urrent re ##la ##pse ##s of active infection . there are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by in ##fect ##ing different cells of the body . some viruses once acquired never leave the body . a typical example is the her ##pes virus , which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise .
greatly out ##weig ##hed by the cost [SEP] diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly . in practice most minor infectious diseases such as war ##ts , cut ##aneous abs ##ces ##ses , respiratory system infections and dia ##rr ##hea ##l diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific ca ##usa ##tive agent . conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent , the presence of a micro ##be in a community , and other ep ##ide ##mi ##ological considerations . given sufficient effort , all known infectious agents can be specifically identified . the benefits of identification , however , are often greatly out ##weig ##hed by the cost , as often there is no specific treatment , the cause is obvious , or the outcome of an infection is benign .
electro ##static attraction [SEP] other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents . almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dye ##s due to the electro ##static attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye . a cell is normally transparent under a microscope , and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background . stain ##ing a cell with a dye such as gi ##em ##sa stain or crystal violet allows a micro ##sco ##pis ##t to describe its size , shape , internal and external components and its associations with other cells . the response of bacteria to different stain ##ing procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of micro ##bes as well . two methods , the gram stain and the acid - fast stain , are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease . the gram stain identifies the bacterial groups firm ##ic ##ute ##s and act ##ino ##ba ##cter ##ia , both of which contain many significant human pathogen ##s . the acid - fast stain ##ing procedure identifies the act ##ino ##ba ##cter ##ial genera my ##co ##ba ##cter ##ium and no ##card ##ia .
humans can make neither rna replica ##ses nor reverse transcript ##ase [SEP] the isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a bio ##chemical diagnosis of an infectious disease . for example , humans can make neither rna replica ##ses nor reverse transcript ##ase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections . the ability of the viral protein hem ##ag ##gl ##uti ##nin to bind red blood cells together into a detect ##able matrix may also be characterized as a bio ##chemical test for viral infection , although strictly speaking hem ##ag ##gl ##uti ##nin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function .
prevention [SEP] techniques like hand washing , wearing gown ##s , and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another . frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms . there are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs , using a condom , and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise . cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important .
victims experience only internal hem ##or ##rh ##aging [SEP] one of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases . some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include vi ##ru ##lence , distance traveled by victims , and level of con ##tag ##ious ##ness . the human strains of e ##bola virus , for example , inca ##pac ##itate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after . as a result , the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone . also , this virus must spread through skin lesions or per ##me ##able membranes such as the eye . thus , the initial stage of e ##bola is not very con ##tag ##ious since its victims experience only internal hem ##or ##rh ##aging . as a result of the above features , the spread of e ##bola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area . in contrast , the human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus ( hiv ) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system . as a result , many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease . also , the relatively low vi ##ru ##lence allows its victims to travel long distances , increasing the likelihood of an epidemic .
food [SEP] hunting is the practice of killing or trapping any animal , or pursuing or tracking it with the intent of doing so . hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food , recreation , to remove predators which are dangerous to humans or domestic animals , or for trade . in the 2010s , lawful hunting is distinguished from po ##achi ##ng , which is the illegal killing , trapping or capture of the hunted species . the species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds .

un ##suit ##ed for pastoral uses or agriculture [SEP] even as animal domestic ##ation became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . the supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sin ##ew for cord ##age , fur , feathers , raw ##hide and leather used in clothing . man ' s earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the at ##lat ##l , and bows and arrows . hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those un ##suit ##ed for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] for example , inuit people in the arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kay ##aks , clothing , and foot ##wear .
died [SEP] hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation , as well as a sport of the king ##ly . even figures considered god ##ly are described to have engaged in hunting . one of the names of the god shiva is mri ##ga ##vy ##ad ##ha , which translates as " the deer hunter " ( mri ##ga means deer ; v ##yad ##ha means hunter ) . the word mri ##ga , in many indian languages including malayalam , not only stands for deer , but for all animals and animal instincts ( mri ##ga th ##rish ##na ) . shiva , as mri ##ga ##vy ##ad ##ha , is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings . in the epic rama ##yana , dash ##arat ##ha , the father of rama , is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark . during one of his hunting expeditions , he accidentally killed sh ##ra ##vana , mist ##aking him for game . during rama ' s exile in the forest , ra ##vana kidnapped his wife , sit ##a , from their hut , while rama was asked by sit ##a to capture a golden deer , and his brother la ##ks ##hman went after him . according to the maha ##bha ##rat , pan ##du , the father of the panda ##vas , accidentally killed the sage kinda ##ma and his wife with an arrow , mist ##aking them for a deer . krishna is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter .
to provide new zealand ##ers with sport and a hunting resource [SEP] new zealand has a strong hunting culture . the islands making up new zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . however , once europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acc ##lim ##ati ##sation societies to provide new zealand ##ers with sport and a hunting resource . deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , ta ##hr and cha ##mo ##is all adapted well to the new zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . government agencies view the animals as pest ##s due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .

because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques [SEP] during the feudal and colonial times in british india , hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states , as many maharaja ##s and nawab ##s , as well as british officers , maintained a whole corps of shi ##kari ##s ( big - game hunters ) , who were native professional hunters . they would be headed by a master of the hunt , who might be styled mir - shi ##kar . often , they recruited the normally low - ranking local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment and hunting techniques . big game , such as bengal tigers , might be hunted from the back of an elephant .

becomes government property [SEP] regional social norms are generally antagonist ##ic to hunting , while a few sect ##s , such as the bis ##hn ##oi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the ant ##elo ##pe . india ' s wildlife protection act of 1972 ban ##s the killing of all wild animals . however , the chief wildlife warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or disease ##d as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . in this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
form of ve ##rmin control to protect livestock [SEP] unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the united kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . what in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in britain . originally a form of ve ##rmin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hare ##s with hounds . pairs of sight hounds ( or long - dogs ) , such as greyhound ##s , may be used to pursue a hare in co ##urs ##ing , where the greyhound ##s are marked as to their skill in co ##urs ##ing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as bea ##gles or ha ##rrier ##s . other sorts of fox ##ho ##unds may also be used for hunting st ##ags ( deer ) or min ##k . deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
help load shotgun ##s [SEP] shooting as practised in britain , as opposed to traditional hunting , requires little quest ##ing for game — around thirty - five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year , some having been factory farm ##ed . shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotgun ##s . when in position , " beat ##ers " move through the areas of cover , swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out . such events are often called " drives " . the open season for gr ##ouse in the uk begins on 12 august , the so - called glorious twelfth . the definition of game in the united kingdom is governed by the game act 1831 .
safety reasons [SEP] gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category , area within the state , and time period . regulations for big - game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms . the use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high population den ##sities or limited topographic relief . regulations may also limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns . specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle - loading black - powder guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective weapons .

threaten the well - being of other species [SEP] hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well - being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] however , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for ' population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] in some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migration ##s into an area , thus artificial ##ly increasing the population . hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intra ##sp ##ec ##ific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . some environmental ##ists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
s typically discarded [SEP] in the 19th century , southern and central european sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pe ##lt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . the rest of the animal was typically discarded . some cultures , however , di ##sa ##pp ##rove of such waste . in nordic countries , hunting for trophies was — and still is — frowned upon . hunting in north america in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] the safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in africa , india and other places in pursuit of trophies . in modern times , trophy hunting persist ##s and is a significant industry in some areas . [ citation needed ]
creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas [SEP] a scientific study in the journal , biological conservation , states that trophy hunting is of " major importance to conservation in africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas , including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife - based land uses such as photographic eco ##tour ##ism . " however , another study states that less than 3 % of a trophy hunters ' expenditures reach the local level , meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is " minimal , particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy . "
the species ' striking appearance [SEP] the arabian or ##yx , a species of large ant ##elo ##pe , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the middle east . however , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related sci ##mit ##ar - horned or ##yx and add ##ax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] the use of automobiles and high - powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . the sci ##mit ##ar - horned or ##yx followed suit , while the add ##ax became critically endangered . however , the arabian or ##yx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from “ extinct in the wild ” to “ vulnerable ” due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
for their hides [SEP] the american bison is a large bo ##vid which inhabited much of western north america prior to the 1800s , living on the prairie ##s in large herds . however , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near - threatened .
a pre ##ci ##pit ##ous wildlife decline [SEP] in contrast , botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following a pre ##ci ##pit ##ous wildlife decline . the numbers of ant ##elo ##pe plum ##met ##ed across botswana , with a resultant decline in predator numbers , while elephant numbers remained stable and hip ##pop ##ota ##mus numbers rose . according to the government of botswana , trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this , but many other factors , such as po ##achi ##ng , drought and habitat loss are also to blame . uganda recently did the same , arguing that " the share of benefits of sport hunting were lo ##ps ##ided and unlikely to deter po ##achi ##ng or improve [ uganda ' s ] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves . "
hilly terrain [SEP] the total length of roads in nepal is recorded to be ( 17 , 182 km ( 10 , 67 ##6 mi ) ) , as of 2003 – 04 . this fairly large network has helped the economic development of the country , particularly in the fields of agriculture , ho ##rti ##culture , vegetable farming , industry and also tourism . in view of the hilly terrain , transportation takes place in kathmandu are mainly by road and air . kathmandu is connected by the tri ##bh ##u ##van highway to the south , pri ##th ##vi highway to the west and ara ##nik ##o highway to the north . the bp highway , connecting kathmandu to the eastern part of nepal is under construction .
