S-247	co ##valent compounds have different properties than ionic compounds co ##valent compounds have different properties than ionic compounds because of their bonds . co ##valent compounds exist as individual molecules rather than crystals . it takes less energy for individual molecules than ions in a crystal to pull apart . as a result , co ##valent compounds have lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds . many are gases or liquids at room temperature . co ##valent compounds have shared electrons . these are not free to move like the transferred electrons of ionic compounds . this makes co ##valent compounds poor conductors of electricity . many co ##valent compounds also do not dissolve in water as all ionic compounds do .

S-57	the high al ##bedo many factors influence the climate of a region . the most important factor is latitude because different latitude ##s receive different amounts of solar radiation . the equator receives the most solar radiation . days are equally long year - round and the sun is just about directly overhead at midday . the polar regions receive the least solar radiation . the night lasts six months during the winter . even in summer , the sun never rises very high in the sky . sunlight filters through a thick wedge of atmosphere , making the sunlight much less intense . the high al ##bedo , because of ice and snow , reflects a good portion of the suns light .

S-141	thermal pollution is a reduction in the quality of water if heated water is released into a body of water , it may cause thermal pollution . thermal pollution is a reduction in the quality of water because of an increase in water temperature . a common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a cool ##ant by power plants and factories . this water is heated and then returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature . warm water can ##t hold as much dissolved oxygen as cool water , so an increase in the temperature of water decreases the amount of oxygen it contains . fish and other organisms adapted to a particular temperature range and oxygen concentration may be killed by the change in water temperature .

S-60	its angular momentum the most widely accepted explanation of how the solar system formed is called the nebula ##r hypothesis . according to this hypothesis , the sun and the planets of our solar system formed about 4 . 6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust , called a nebula . the nebula was drawn together by gravity , which released gravitational potential energy . as small particles of dust and gas smashed together to create larger ones , they released kinetic energy . as the nebula collapsed , the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin because of its angular momentum . as it collapsed further , the spinning got faster , much as an ice skater spins faster when he pulls his arms to his sides during a spin . much of the clouds mass migrated to its center but the rest of the material flattened out in an enormous disk . the disk contained hydrogen and helium , along with heavier elements and even simple organic molecules .

S-6	oceans coastal areas have a mild ##er climate than inland areas . they are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer . that ##s because land near an ocean is influenced by the temperature of the oceans . the temperature of ocean water is moderate and stable . why ? there are two major reasons : 1 . water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land . as a result , oceans never get as hot or as cold as land . 2 . water flows through all the worlds oceans . warm water from the equator mixes with cold water from the poles . the mixing of warm and cold water makes the water temperature moderate . even inland temperatures are mild ##er because of oceans . without oceans , there would be much bigger temperature swings all over earth . temperatures might plunge hundreds of degrees below freezing in the winter . in the summer , lakes and seas might boil ! life as we know it could not exist on earth without the oceans .

S-61	as the nebula collapsed , the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin the most widely accepted explanation of how the solar system formed is called the nebula ##r hypothesis . according to this hypothesis , the sun and the planets of our solar system formed about 4 . 6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust , called a nebula . the nebula was drawn together by gravity , which released gravitational potential energy . as small particles of dust and gas smashed together to create larger ones , they released kinetic energy . as the nebula collapsed , the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin because of its angular momentum . as it collapsed further , the spinning got faster , much as an ice skater spins faster when he pulls his arms to his sides during a spin . much of the clouds mass migrated to its center but the rest of the material flattened out in an enormous disk . the disk contained hydrogen and helium , along with heavier elements and even simple organic molecules .

S-203	according to einstein , objects curve toward one another newton ##s idea of gravity can predict the motion of most but not all objects . in the early 1900s , albert einstein came up with a theory of gravity that is better at predicting how all objects move . einstein showed mathematical ##ly that gravity is not really a force in the sense that newton thought . instead , gravity is a result of the warp ##ing , or curving , of space and time . imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a tram ##pol ##ine . the surface of the tram ##pol ##ine would curve downward instead of being flat . einstein theo ##rized that earth and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a similar way . this idea is represented in figure 13 . 19 . according to einstein , objects curve toward one another because of the curves in space and time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction as newton thought . you can see an animation of einstein ##s theory of gravity at this ur ##l : http : / / einstein . theory of gravity , go to this ur ##l :

S-214	the wedge shape of the blade imagine trying to slice a tomato with a fork or spoon instead of a knife , like the one in figure 16 . 15 . the knife makes the job a lot easier because of the wedge shape of the blade . a wedge is a simple machine that consists of two inclined planes . but unlike one inclined plane , a wedge works only when it moves . it has a thin end and thick end , and the thin end is forced into an object to cut or split it . the chi ##sel in figure 16 . 15 is another example of a wedge . the input force is applied to the thick end of a wedge , and it acts over the length of the wedge . the output force pushes against the object on both sides of the wedge , so the output distance is the thickness of the wedge . therefore , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge can be calculated as : ideal mechanical advantage = length of wedge maximum thickness of wedge the length of a wedge is always greater than its maximum thickness . as a result , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge is always greater than 1 .

S-266	the wheels efficiency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user ( input work ) that becomes work done by the machine ( output work ) . the output work is always less than the input work because some of the input work is used to overcome friction . therefore , efficiency is always less than 100 percent . the closer to 100 percent a machines efficiency is , the better it is at reducing friction . look at the ramp in the figure 1 . 1 . a ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane . it is easier to push the heavy piece of furniture up the ramp to the truck than to lift it straight up off the ground , but pushing the furniture over the surface of the ramp creates a lot of friction . some of the force applied to moving the furniture must be used to overcome the friction with the ramp . q : why would it be more efficient to use a dolly to roll the furniture up the ramp ? a : there would be less friction to overcome if you used a dolly because of the wheels . so the efficiency of the ramp would be greater with the dolly .

S-215	the knife makes the job a lot easier imagine trying to slice a tomato with a fork or spoon instead of a knife , like the one in figure 16 . 15 . the knife makes the job a lot easier because of the wedge shape of the blade . a wedge is a simple machine that consists of two inclined planes . but unlike one inclined plane , a wedge works only when it moves . it has a thin end and thick end , and the thin end is forced into an object to cut or split it . the chi ##sel in figure 16 . 15 is another example of a wedge . the input force is applied to the thick end of a wedge , and it acts over the length of the wedge . the output force pushes against the object on both sides of the wedge , so the output distance is the thickness of the wedge . therefore , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge can be calculated as : ideal mechanical advantage = length of wedge maximum thickness of wedge the length of a wedge is always greater than its maximum thickness . as a result , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge is always greater than 1 .

S-255	the more massive bowling ball is also harder to move what if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the same distance above the ground ? the bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball , so the pull of gravity on it is greater . would it fall to the ground faster ? no , the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time . the reason ? the more massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass , so it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the soccer ball . this is true of all falling objects . they all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity , unless air resistance affects one object more than another . for example , a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling ac ##orn because of the leafs greater surface area . q : if a leaf and an ac ##orn were to fall to the ground in the absence of air ( that is , in a vacuum ) , how would this affect their acceleration due to gravity ? a : they would both accelerate at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time .

S-269	according to einstein , objects move toward one another einstein derived his theory using mathematics . however , you can get a good grasp of it with the help of a simple visual analogy . imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a tram ##pol ##ine . the surface of the tram ##pol ##ine would curve downward instead of being flat . now imagine placing a lighter ball at the edge of the tram ##pol ##ine . what will happen ? it will roll down toward the bowling ball . this apparent attraction to the bowling ball occurs because the tram ##pol ##ine curves downward , not because the two balls are actually attracted to one another by an invisible force called gravity . einstein theo ##rized that the sun and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a way that is similar to the effect of the bowling ball on the tram ##pol ##ine . the more massive a body is , the more it causes space - time to curve . this idea is represented by the figure 1 . 1 . according to einstein , objects move toward one another because of the curves in space - time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction . einstein ##s theory is supported by evidence and widely accepted today , although newton ##s law is still used for many calculations .

S-239	however in radio broadcasts , sounds are encoded in radio waves that are sent out through the atmosphere from a radio tower . a receiver detect ##s the radio waves and changes them back to sounds . you ##ve probably listened to both am and fm radio stations . how sounds are encoded in radio waves differs between am and fm broadcasts . am stands for amplitude modulation . in am broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the amplitude of radio waves . am broadcasts use longer ##wave ##len ##gt ##h radio waves than fm broadcasts . because of their longer wavelengths , am radio waves reflect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called the ion ##osphere . you can see how this happens in figure 21 . 8 . this allows am radio waves to reach radio receivers that are very far away from the radio tower . fm stands for frequency modulation . in fm broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency of radio waves . frequency modulation allows fm waves to en ##code more information than does amplitude modulation , so fm broadcasts usually sound clearer than am broadcasts . however , because of their shorter wavelength , fm waves do not reflect off the ion ##osphere . instead , they pass right through it and out into space ( see figure 21 . 8 ) . as a result , fm waves cannot reach very distant receivers .

S-137	the rise in greenhouse gases another major problem caused by air pollution is global climate change . gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels increase the greenhouse effect and raise earth ##s temperature . the greenhouse effect is a natural feature of earth ##s atmosphere . it occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere , including carbon dioxide , ra ##dia ##te the suns heat back down to earth ##s surface . figure 25 . 2 shows how this happens . without greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , the heat would escape into space . the natural greenhouse effect of earth ##s atmosphere keeps the planets temperature within a range that can support life . the rise in greenhouse gases due to human actions is too much of a good thing . it increases the greenhouse effect and causes earth ##s average temperature to rise . rising global temperatures , in turn , are melting polar ice caps and glaciers . figure 25 . 3 shows how much smaller the arctic ice cap was in 2012 than it was in 1984 . with more liquid water on earth ##s surface , sea levels are rising . adding more heat energy to earth ##s atmosphere also causes more extreme weather and changes in precipitation patterns . global warming is already causing food and water shortages and species extinction ##s . these problems will only grow worse unless steps are taken to curb greenhouse gases and global climate change .

S-268	the curves in space - time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction einstein derived his theory using mathematics . however , you can get a good grasp of it with the help of a simple visual analogy . imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a tram ##pol ##ine . the surface of the tram ##pol ##ine would curve downward instead of being flat . now imagine placing a lighter ball at the edge of the tram ##pol ##ine . what will happen ? it will roll down toward the bowling ball . this apparent attraction to the bowling ball occurs because the tram ##pol ##ine curves downward , not because the two balls are actually attracted to one another by an invisible force called gravity . einstein theo ##rized that the sun and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a way that is similar to the effect of the bowling ball on the tram ##pol ##ine . the more massive a body is , the more it causes space - time to curve . this idea is represented by the figure 1 . 1 . according to einstein , objects move toward one another because of the curves in space - time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction . einstein ##s theory is supported by evidence and widely accepted today , although newton ##s law is still used for many calculations .

S-262	the transmitted light an opaque object is one that doesn ##t let light pass through it . instead , it reflects or absorb ##s the light that strikes it . many objects , such as the leaves pictured in the figure 1 . 3 , reflect just one or a few wavelengths of visible light and absorb the rest . the wavelengths that are reflected determine the color that an object appears to the human eye . for example , the leaves appear green because they reflect green light and absorb light of other wavelengths . a transparent or translucent material , such as window glass , transmit ##s some or all of the light that strikes it . this means that the light passes through the material rather than being reflected by it . in this case , we see the material because of the transmitted light . therefore , the wavelength of the transmitted light determines the color that the object appears . look at the beautiful stained glass windows in the figure 1 . 4 . the different colors of glass transmit the color of light that strikes an object may also affect the color that the object appears . for example , if only blue light strikes green leaves , the blue light is absorbed and no light is reflected . q : what color do you see if an object absorb ##s all of the light that strikes it ? a : when all of the light is absorbed , none is reflected , so the object looks black . but black isn ##t a color of light . black is the absence of light .

S-263	in this case , we see the material an opaque object is one that doesn ##t let light pass through it . instead , it reflects or absorb ##s the light that strikes it . many objects , such as the leaves pictured in the figure 1 . 3 , reflect just one or a few wavelengths of visible light and absorb the rest . the wavelengths that are reflected determine the color that an object appears to the human eye . for example , the leaves appear green because they reflect green light and absorb light of other wavelengths . a transparent or translucent material , such as window glass , transmit ##s some or all of the light that strikes it . this means that the light passes through the material rather than being reflected by it . in this case , we see the material because of the transmitted light . therefore , the wavelength of the transmitted light determines the color that the object appears . look at the beautiful stained glass windows in the figure 1 . 4 . the different colors of glass transmit the color of light that strikes an object may also affect the color that the object appears . for example , if only blue light strikes green leaves , the blue light is absorbed and no light is reflected . q : what color do you see if an object absorb ##s all of the light that strikes it ? a : when all of the light is absorbed , none is reflected , so the object looks black . but black isn ##t a color of light . black is the absence of light .

S-19	why don ##t they crash into earth why do satellites stay in orbit ? why don ##t they crash into earth due to the planets gravity ? newton ##s law of universal gr ##avi ##tation describes what happens . every object in the universe is attracted to every other object . gravity makes an apple fall to the ground . gravity also keeps you from floating away into the sky . gravity holds the moon in orbit around earth . it keeps earth in orbit around the sun . newton used an example to explain how gravity makes orbiting possible . imagine a cannon ##ball launched from a high mountain , as shown in figure 23 . 17 . if the cannon ##ball is launched at a slow speed , it will fall back to earth . this is shown as paths ( a ) and ( b ) . something different happens if the cannon ##ball is launched at a fast speed . the earth below curves away at the same rate that the cannon ##ball falls . the cannon ##ball then goes into a circular orbit , as in path ( c ) . if the cannon ##ball is launched even faster , it could go into an elliptical orbit ( d ) . it might even leave earth ##s gravity and go into space ( e ) . unfortunately , newton ##s idea would not work in real life . a cannon ##ball launched at a fast speed from mt . everest would not go into orbit . the cannon ##ball would burn up in the atmosphere . however , a rocket can launch straight up , then steer into orbit . it won ##t burn up in the orbit . a rocket can carry a satellite above the atmosphere and then release the satellite into orbit .

S-178	chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions air is all around us . air is essential for life . sometimes , humans can poll ##ute the air . for example , releasing smoke and dust from factories and cars can cause air pollution . air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions . this pollution affects entire ecosystems around the world . pollution can also cause many human health problems , and it can also cause death . air pollution can be found both outdoors and indoors . outdoor air pollution is made of chemical particles . when smoke or other poll ##uta ##nts enter the air , the particles found in the pollution mix with the air . air is poll ##uted when it contains many large toxic particles . outdoor air pollution changes the natural characteristics of the atmosphere . primary poll ##uta ##nts are added directly to the atmosphere . fires add primary poll ##uta ##nts to the air . particles released from the fire directly enter the air and cause pollution ( figure 1 . 1 ) . burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal is a major source of primary poll ##uta ##nts ( figure secondary poll ##uta ##nts are formed when primary poll ##uta ##nts interact with sunlight , air , or each other . they do not directly cause pollution . however , when they interact with other parts of the air , they do cause pollution . for example , ozone is created when some poll ##uta ##nts interact with sunlight . high levels of ozone in the atmosphere can cause problems for humans . wild ##fires , either natural or human - caused , release particles into the air , one of the many causes of air pollution . a major source of air pollution is the burn - ing of fossil fuels from factories , power plants , and motor vehicles .

S-194	these sensory neurons found inside of your body when you look at the prick ##ly cactus pictured below ( figure 1 . 1 ) , does the word " ou ##ch " come to mind ? touching the cactus would be painful . touch is the sense of pain , pressure , or temperature . touch depends on sensory neurons , or nerve cells , in the skin . the skin on the palms of the hands , sole ##s of the feet , and face has the most sensory neurons and is especially sensitive to touch . the tongue and lips are very sensitive to touch as well . neurons that sense pain are also found inside the body in muscles , joints , and organs . if you have a stomach ache or pain from a sp ##rained ankle , its because of these sensory neurons found inside of your body . the following example shows how messages about touch travel from sensory neurons to the brain , as well as how the brain responds to the messages . suppose you wanted to test the temperature of the water in a lake before jumping in . you might stick one bare foot in the water . neurons in the skin on your foot would sense the temperature of the water and send a message about it to your central nervous system . the frontal lobe of the ce ##re ##br ##um would process the information . it might decide that the water is really cold and send a message to your muscles to pull your foot out of the water . in some cases , messages about pain or temperature don ##t travel all the way to and from the brain . instead , they travel only as far as the spinal cord , and the spinal cord responds to the messages by giving orders to the muscles . this allows you to respond to pain more quickly . when messages avoid the brain in this way , it forms a reflex arc , like the one shown below ( figure 1 . 2 ) .

S-195	if you have a stomach ache or pain from a sp ##rained ankle , its when you look at the prick ##ly cactus pictured below ( figure 1 . 1 ) , does the word " ou ##ch " come to mind ? touching the cactus would be painful . touch is the sense of pain , pressure , or temperature . touch depends on sensory neurons , or nerve cells , in the skin . the skin on the palms of the hands , sole ##s of the feet , and face has the most sensory neurons and is especially sensitive to touch . the tongue and lips are very sensitive to touch as well . neurons that sense pain are also found inside the body in muscles , joints , and organs . if you have a stomach ache or pain from a sp ##rained ankle , its because of these sensory neurons found inside of your body . the following example shows how messages about touch travel from sensory neurons to the brain , as well as how the brain responds to the messages . suppose you wanted to test the temperature of the water in a lake before jumping in . you might stick one bare foot in the water . neurons in the skin on your foot would sense the temperature of the water and send a message about it to your central nervous system . the frontal lobe of the ce ##re ##br ##um would process the information . it might decide that the water is really cold and send a message to your muscles to pull your foot out of the water . in some cases , messages about pain or temperature don ##t travel all the way to and from the brain . instead , they travel only as far as the spinal cord , and the spinal cord responds to the messages by giving orders to the muscles . this allows you to respond to pain more quickly . when messages avoid the brain in this way , it forms a reflex arc , like the one shown below ( figure 1 . 2 ) .

S-204	its greater mass when gravity pulls objects toward the ground , it causes them to accelerate . acceleration due to gravity equals 9 . 8 m / s ##2 . in other words , the velocity at which an object falls toward earth increases each second by 9 . 8 m / s . therefore , after 1 second , an object is falling at a velocity of 9 . 8 m / s . after 2 seconds , it is falling at a velocity of 19 . 6 m / s ( 9 . 8 m / s 2 ) , and so on . this is illustrated in figure 13 . 20 . you can compare the acceleration due to gravity on earth , the moon , and mars with the interactive animation called " free ##fall " at this ur ##l : http : / / jersey . u ##ore ##gon . ed ##u / v ##lab / . you might think that an object with greater mass would accelerate faster than an object with less mass . after all , its greater mass means that it is pulled by a stronger force of gravity . however , a more massive object accelerate ##s at the same rate as a less massive object . the reason ? the more massive object is harder to move because of its greater mass . as a result , it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the less massive object . consider a bowling ball and a basketball . the bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball . however , if you were to drop both balls at the same time from the same distance above the ground , they would reach the ground together . this is true of all falling objects , unless air resistance affects one object more than another . for example , a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling ac ##orn because of the leafs greater surface area . however , if the leaf and ac ##orn were to fall in the absence of air ( that is , in a vacuum ) , they would reach the ground at the same time .

S-174	lifting against gravity when skeletal muscles contract , bones move . but how do muscles make your bones move ? a voluntary muscles usually works across a joint . it is attached to both the bones on either side of the joint by strong cords called tend ##ons . a tend ##on is a tough band of connect ##ive tissue that connects a muscle to a bone . tend ##ons are similar to ligament ##s , except that ligament ##s join bones to each other . muscles move the body by contracting against the skeleton . when muscles contract , they get shorter . by contracting , muscles pull on bones and allow the body to move . muscles can only contract . they cannot actively extend , though they can move or relax back into the non - contracted neutral position . therefore , to move bones in opposite directions , pairs of muscles must work in opposition . each muscle in the pair works against the other to move bones at the joints of the body . the muscle that contracts to cause a joint to bend is called the flex ##or . the muscle that contracts to cause the joint to straighten is called the ex ##tens ##or . when one muscle is contracted , the other muscle from the pair is always elongated . for example , the biceps and tri ##ce ##ps muscles work together to allow you to bend and straighten your elbow . when you want to bend your elbow , your biceps muscle contracts ( figure 1 . 1 ) , and , at the same time , the tri ##ce ##ps muscle relax ##es . the biceps is the flex ##or , and the tri ##ce ##ps is the ex ##tens ##or of your elbow joint . other muscles that work together are the quad ##rice ##ps and ham ##st ##ring ##s used to bend and straighten the knee , and the pe ##ctor ##als and trap ##ez ##ius used to move the arms and shoulders forward and backward . during daily routines we do not use muscles equally . for example , we use our biceps more than our tri ##ce ##ps due to lifting against gravity .

S-205	the more massive object is harder to move when gravity pulls objects toward the ground , it causes them to accelerate . acceleration due to gravity equals 9 . 8 m / s ##2 . in other words , the velocity at which an object falls toward earth increases each second by 9 . 8 m / s . therefore , after 1 second , an object is falling at a velocity of 9 . 8 m / s . after 2 seconds , it is falling at a velocity of 19 . 6 m / s ( 9 . 8 m / s 2 ) , and so on . this is illustrated in figure 13 . 20 . you can compare the acceleration due to gravity on earth , the moon , and mars with the interactive animation called " free ##fall " at this ur ##l : http : / / jersey . u ##ore ##gon . ed ##u / v ##lab / . you might think that an object with greater mass would accelerate faster than an object with less mass . after all , its greater mass means that it is pulled by a stronger force of gravity . however , a more massive object accelerate ##s at the same rate as a less massive object . the reason ? the more massive object is harder to move because of its greater mass . as a result , it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the less massive object . consider a bowling ball and a basketball . the bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball . however , if you were to drop both balls at the same time from the same distance above the ground , they would reach the ground together . this is true of all falling objects , unless air resistance affects one object more than another . for example , a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling ac ##orn because of the leafs greater surface area . however , if the leaf and ac ##orn were to fall in the absence of air ( that is , in a vacuum ) , they would reach the ground at the same time .

S-175	for example , we use our biceps more than our tri ##ce ##ps when skeletal muscles contract , bones move . but how do muscles make your bones move ? a voluntary muscles usually works across a joint . it is attached to both the bones on either side of the joint by strong cords called tend ##ons . a tend ##on is a tough band of connect ##ive tissue that connects a muscle to a bone . tend ##ons are similar to ligament ##s , except that ligament ##s join bones to each other . muscles move the body by contracting against the skeleton . when muscles contract , they get shorter . by contracting , muscles pull on bones and allow the body to move . muscles can only contract . they cannot actively extend , though they can move or relax back into the non - contracted neutral position . therefore , to move bones in opposite directions , pairs of muscles must work in opposition . each muscle in the pair works against the other to move bones at the joints of the body . the muscle that contracts to cause a joint to bend is called the flex ##or . the muscle that contracts to cause the joint to straighten is called the ex ##tens ##or . when one muscle is contracted , the other muscle from the pair is always elongated . for example , the biceps and tri ##ce ##ps muscles work together to allow you to bend and straighten your elbow . when you want to bend your elbow , your biceps muscle contracts ( figure 1 . 1 ) , and , at the same time , the tri ##ce ##ps muscle relax ##es . the biceps is the flex ##or , and the tri ##ce ##ps is the ex ##tens ##or of your elbow joint . other muscles that work together are the quad ##rice ##ps and ham ##st ##ring ##s used to bend and straighten the knee , and the pe ##ctor ##als and trap ##ez ##ius used to move the arms and shoulders forward and backward . during daily routines we do not use muscles equally . for example , we use our biceps more than our tri ##ce ##ps due to lifting against gravity .

S-109	these differences are often tides are the daily rise and fall of sea level at any given place . the pull of the moons gravity on earth is the primary cause of tides and the pull of the suns gravity on earth is the secondary cause ( figure 1 . 1 ) . the moon has a greater effect because , although it is much smaller than the sun , it is much closer . the moons pull is about twice that of the suns . to understand the tides it is easiest to start with the effect of the moon on earth . as the moon revolves around our planet , its gravity pulls earth toward it . the lit ##hos ##pher ##e is unable to move much , but the water is pulled by the gravity and a bulge is created . this bulge is the high tide beneath the moon . on the other side of the earth , a high tide is produced where the moons pull is weak ##est . these two water bulge ##s on opposite sides of the earth aligned with the moon are the high tides . the places directly in between the high tides are low tides . as the earth rotate ##s beneath the moon , a single spot will experience two high tides and two low tides approximately every day . high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes . the reason is that the moon takes 24 hours and 50 minutes to rotate once around the earth , so the moon is over the same location every 24 hours and 50 minutes . since high tides occur twice a day , one arrives each 12 hours and 25 minutes . what is the time between a high tide and the next low tide ? the gravity of the sun also pulls earth ##s water towards it and causes its own tides . because the sun is so far away , its pull is smaller than the moons . some coastal areas do not follow this pattern at all . these coastal areas may have one high and one low tide per day or a different amount of time between two high tides . these differences are often because of local conditions , such as the shape of the coastline that the tide is entering . the gravitational attraction of the moon to ocean water creates the high and low tides .

S-108	local conditions , such as the shape of the coastline that the tide is entering tides are the daily rise and fall of sea level at any given place . the pull of the moons gravity on earth is the primary cause of tides and the pull of the suns gravity on earth is the secondary cause ( figure 1 . 1 ) . the moon has a greater effect because , although it is much smaller than the sun , it is much closer . the moons pull is about twice that of the suns . to understand the tides it is easiest to start with the effect of the moon on earth . as the moon revolves around our planet , its gravity pulls earth toward it . the lit ##hos ##pher ##e is unable to move much , but the water is pulled by the gravity and a bulge is created . this bulge is the high tide beneath the moon . on the other side of the earth , a high tide is produced where the moons pull is weak ##est . these two water bulge ##s on opposite sides of the earth aligned with the moon are the high tides . the places directly in between the high tides are low tides . as the earth rotate ##s beneath the moon , a single spot will experience two high tides and two low tides approximately every day . high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes . the reason is that the moon takes 24 hours and 50 minutes to rotate once around the earth , so the moon is over the same location every 24 hours and 50 minutes . since high tides occur twice a day , one arrives each 12 hours and 25 minutes . what is the time between a high tide and the next low tide ? the gravity of the sun also pulls earth ##s water towards it and causes its own tides . because the sun is so far away , its pull is smaller than the moons . some coastal areas do not follow this pattern at all . these coastal areas may have one high and one low tide per day or a different amount of time between two high tides . these differences are often because of local conditions , such as the shape of the coastline that the tide is entering . the gravitational attraction of the moon to ocean water creates the high and low tides .

S-168	chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions . when most people think of air pollution , they think of the pollution outdoors . but it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution . your home or school classroom probably doesn ##t get much fresh air . sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs . but this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors . and people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors . so exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk . indoor air poll ##uta ##nts include both chemical and biological poll ##uta ##nts . chemical poll ##uta ##nts include the following : ra ##don , a radioactive gas released from the earth in certain locations . it can become trapped inside buildings and increase your risk of cancer . formal ##deh ##yde , a toxic gas emitted from building materials , such as carpet ##ing and pl ##ywood . volatile organic compounds ( vo ##cs ) , which are given off by paint and solvent ##s as they dry . they can cause cause long - term health effects . second ##hand smoke , which comes from breathing the smoke release from tobacco products . second ##hand smoke is also the smoke exhaled by a cigarette smoke ##r . this smoke is extremely dangerous to human health . carbon mono ##xide ( co ) , a toxic gas released by burning fossil fuels . it is often released indoors by faulty chimneys , gas - powered generators , or burning charcoal ; it can be extremely dangerous . dry cleaning fluids , such as te ##tra ##ch ##lor ##oe ##thy ##lene , which can be released from clothing days after dry cleaning . the past use of asbestos in factories and in homes . asbestos is a very dangerous material , and it was used in many buildings ( figure 1 . 1 ) . asbestos can cause cancer and other lung diseases . the use of asbestos is not allowed today . the use of asbestos in industry and do - me ##stic environments in the past , as in the asbestos - covered pipes in the oil - refining plant pictured here , has left a potentially very dangerous material in many bus ##i - ness ##es . biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors . these are produced from : pet dan ##der . dust from tiny skin fl ##akes and deco ##mp ##osed hair . dust mit ##es . mold from walls , ceilings , and other structures . air conditioning systems that can inc ##uba ##te certain bacteria and mold . pollen , dust , and mold from house ##pl ##ants , soil , and surrounding gardens .

S-188	genes on the x chromosome what determines if a baby is a male or female ? recall that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes ##and one of those pairs is the sex chromosomes . everyone has two sex chromosomes . your sex chromosomes can be x or y . females have two x chromosomes ( xx ) , while males have one x chromosome and one y chromosome ( x ##y ) . if a baby inherit ##s an x chromosome from the father and an x chromosome from the mother , what will be the child ##s sex ? the baby will have two x chromosomes , so it will be female . if the fathers sperm carries the y chromosome , the child will be male . notice that a mother can only pass on an x chromosome , so the sex of the baby is determined by the father . the father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the y or x chromosome , so there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be male , and there is a 50 percent chance a child will be female . this 50 : 50 chance occurs for each baby . a couples first five children could all be boys . the sixth child still has a 50 : 50 chance of being a girl . one special pattern of inheritance that doesn ##t fit men ##del ##s rules is sex - linked inheritance , referring to the in ##her - it ##ance of traits that are located on genes on the sex chromosomes . since males and females do not have the same sex chromosomes , there will be differences between the sexes in how these sex - linked traits ##tra ##its linked to genes located on the sex chromosomes ##are expressed . sex - linked traits usually refer to traits due to genes on the x chromosome . one example of a sex - linked trait is red - green color ##bl ##ind ##ness . people with this type of color ##bl ##ind ##ness cannot tell the difference between red and green . they often see these colors as shades of brown ( figure 1 . 1 ) . boys are much more likely to be color ##bl ##ind than girls ( table 1 . 1 ) . this is because color ##bl ##ind ##ness is a sex - linked , recess ##ive trait . boys only have one x chromosome , so if that chromosome carries the gene for color ##bl ##ind ##ness , they will be color ##bl ##ind . as girls have two x chromosomes , a girl can have one x chromosome with the color ##bl ##ind gene and one x chromosome with a normal gene for color vision . since color ##bl ##ind ##ness is recess ##ive , the dominant normal gene will mask the recess ##ive color ##bl ##ind gene . females with one color ##bl ##ind ##ness all ##ele and one normal all ##ele are referred

S-106	his contributions directly to astronomy , and galileo gal ##ile ##i ( 156 ##4 - 1642 ) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy , both because of his contributions directly to astronomy , and because of his work in physics . he provided the crucial observations that proved the cope ##rn ##ica ##n hypothesis , and also laid the foundations for a correct understanding of how objects moved on the surface of the earth and of gravity . one could , with considerable justification , view galileo as the father both of modern astronomy and of modern physics . galileo did not in ##vent the telescope , but he was the first to turn his telescope toward the sky to study the heavens systematically . his telescope was poorer than even a cheap modern amateur telescope , but what he observed in the heavens showed errors in aristotle ##s opinion of the universe and the world ##view that it supported . observations through galileo ##s telescope made it clear that the earth - centered and earth doesn ##t move solar system of aristotle was incorrect . since church officials had made some of aristotle ##s opinions a part of the religious views of the church , proving aristotle ##s views to be incorrect also pointed out flaws in the church . galileo observed four points of light that changed their positions around the planet jupiter and he concluded that these were moons in orbit around jupiter . these observations showed that there were new things in the heavens that aristotle and ptolemy had known nothing about . furthermore , they demonstrated that a planet could have moons circling it that would not be left behind as the planet moved around its orbit . one of the arguments against the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system had been that if the moon were in orbit around the earth and the earth in orbit around the sun , the earth would leave the moon behind as it moved around its orbit . galileo used his telescope to show that venus , like the moon , went through a complete set of phases . this observation was extremely important because it was the first observation that was consistent with the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system but not the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system . in the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system , venus should always be in crescent phase as viewed from the earth because the sun is beyond venus , but in the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system venus should exhibit a complete set of phases over time as viewed from the earth because it is illuminated from the center of its orbit . it is important to note that this was the first empirical evidence ( coming almost a century after cope ##rn ##icus ) that allowed a definitive test of the two models . until that point , both the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic and cope ##rn ##ica ##n models described the available data . the
