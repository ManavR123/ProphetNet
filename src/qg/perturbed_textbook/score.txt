S-230	the high al ##bedo many factors influence the climate of a region . the most important factor is latitude because different latitude ##s receive different amounts of solar radiation . the equator receives the most solar radiation . days are equally long year - round and the sun is just about directly overhead at midday . the polar regions receive the least solar radiation . the night lasts six months during the winter . even in summer , the sun never rises very high in the sky . sunlight filters through a thick wedge of atmosphere , making the sunlight much less intense . the high al ##bedo , due to ice and snow , reflects a good portion of the suns light .

S-561	an increase in water temperature if heated water is released into a body of water , it may cause thermal pollution . thermal pollution is a reduction in the quality of water as a result of an increase in water temperature . a common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a cool ##ant by power plants and factories . this water is heated and then returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature . warm water can ##t hold as much dissolved oxygen as cool water , so an increase in the temperature of water decreases the amount of oxygen it contains . fish and other organisms adapted to a particular temperature range and oxygen concentration may be killed by the change in water temperature .

S-129	nuclear fusion stars shine as a result of nuclear fusion . fusion reactions in the suns core keep our nearest star burning . stars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium . both are very lightweight gases . a star contains so much hydrogen and helium that the weight of these gases is enormous . the pressure at the center of a star is great enough to heat the gases . this causes nuclear fusion reactions . a nuclear fusion reaction is named that because the nuclei ( center ) of two atoms fuse ( join ) together . in stars like our sun , two hydrogen atoms join together to create a helium atom . nuclear fusion reactions need a lot of energy to get started . once they begin , they produce even more energy .

S-1253	standing waves occur waves may reflect off an obstacle that they are unable to pass through . when waves are reflected straight back from an obstacle , the reflected waves interfere with the original waves and create standing waves . these are waves that appear to be standing still . standing waves occur as a result of a combination of constructive and destructive interference . q : how could you use a rope to produce standing waves ? a : you could tie one end of the rope to a fixed object , such as door ##k ##nob , and move the other end up and down to generate waves in the rope . when the waves reach the fixed object , they are reflected back . the original waves and the reflected waves interfere to produce a standing wave . try it yourself and see if the waves appear to stand still .

S-397	water expands when it freeze ##s , has high surface tension water is simply two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen bonded together ( figure 1 . 1 ) . the hydrogen ions are on one side of the oxygen ion , making water a polar molecule . this means that one side , the side with the hydrogen ions , has a slightly positive electrical charge . the other side , the side without the hydrogen ions , has a slightly negative charge . despite its simplicity , water has remarkable properties . water expands when it freeze ##s , has high surface tension ( as a result of the polar nature of the molecules , they tend to stick together ) , and others . without water , life might not be able to exist on earth and it certainly would not have the tremendous complexity and diversity that we see .

S-62	more recently , the death rate has fallen more recently , the death rate has fallen due to the availability of more food and medical advances : a green revolution began in the mid 1900s . new methods and products increased how much food could be grown . for example , chemicals were developed that killed weeds without harm ##ing crops . pest ##icides were developed that killed pest ##s that destroyed crops . va ##cci ##nation ##s were developed that could prevent many diseases ( see figure 18 . 19 ) . antibiotics were disco ##v - er ##ed that could cure most infections caused by bacteria . together , these two advances saved countless lives . today in many countries , death rates have gone down but birth rates remain high . this means that the population is growing . figure 18 . 20 shows the growth rates of human populations all over the world .

S-1216	the movement of air molecules , water drops , and ice particles another example of static discharge , but on a much larger scale , is lightning . you can see how it occurs in the following diagram ( figure 1 . 1 ) . during a rains ##torm , clouds develop regions of positive and negative charge because of the movement of air molecules , water drops , and ice particles . the negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds , and the positive charges are concentrated at the top . the negative charges rep ##el electrons on the ground beneath them , so the ground below the clouds becomes positively charged . at first , the atmosphere prevents electrons from flowing away from areas of negative charge and toward areas of positive charge . as more charges build up , however , the air between the opposite ##ly charged areas also becomes charged . when this happens , static electricity is discharged as bolts of lightning .

S-1218	the movement of air molecules , water drops , and ice particles another example of static discharge , but on a much larger scale , is lightning . you can see how it occurs in the following diagram ( figure 1 . 1 ) . during a rains ##torm , clouds develop regions of positive and negative charge due to the movement of air molecules , water drops , and ice particles . the negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds , and the positive charges are concentrated at the top . the negative charges rep ##el electrons on the ground beneath them , so the ground below the clouds becomes positively charged . at first , the atmosphere prevents electrons from flowing away from areas of negative charge and toward areas of positive charge . as more charges build up , however , the air between the opposite ##ly charged areas also becomes charged . when this happens , static electricity is discharged as bolts of lightning .

S-17	heavy rains a flood occurs when a river over ##flow ##s it banks . this might happen as a result of heavy rains . flood ##pl ##ains as the water spreads out over the land , it slow ##s down and drops its sediment . if a river floods often , the flood ##pl ##ain develops a thick layer of rich soil as a result of all the deposits . that ##s why flood ##pl ##ains are usually good places for growing plants . for example , the nile river in egypt provides both water and thick sediments for raising crops in the middle of a sandy desert . natural lev ##ees a flooding river often forms natural lev ##ees along its banks . a lev ##ee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge . you can see how lev ##ees form in figure 10 . 8 . lev ##ees occur because flood ##water ##s deposit their biggest sediments first when they over ##flow the rivers banks .

S-1221	during a rains ##torm , clouds develop regions of positive and negative charge another example of static discharge , but on a much larger scale , is lightning . you can see how it occurs in the following diagram ( figure 1 . 1 ) . during a rains ##torm , clouds develop regions of positive and negative charge as a result of the movement of air molecules , water drops , and ice particles . the negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds , and the positive charges are concentrated at the top . the negative charges rep ##el electrons on the ground beneath them , so the ground below the clouds becomes positively charged . at first , the atmosphere prevents electrons from flowing away from areas of negative charge and toward areas of positive charge . as more charges build up , however , the air between the opposite ##ly charged areas also becomes charged . when this happens , static electricity is discharged as bolts of lightning .

S-242	its angular momentum the most widely accepted explanation of how the solar system formed is called the nebula ##r hypothesis . according to this hypothesis , the sun and the planets of our solar system formed about 4 . 6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust , called a nebula . the nebula was drawn together by gravity , which released gravitational potential energy . as small particles of dust and gas smashed together to create larger ones , they released kinetic energy . as the nebula collapsed , the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin due to its angular momentum . as it collapsed further , the spinning got faster , much as an ice skater spins faster when he pulls his arms to his sides during a spin . much of the clouds mass migrated to its center but the rest of the material flattened out in an enormous disk . the disk contained hydrogen and helium , along with heavier elements and even simple organic molecules .

S-25	oceans coastal areas have a mild ##er climate than inland areas . they are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer . that ##s because land near an ocean is influenced by the temperature of the oceans . the temperature of ocean water is moderate and stable . why ? there are two major reasons : 1 . water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land . as a result , oceans never get as hot or as cold as land . 2 . water flows through all the worlds oceans . warm water from the equator mixes with cold water from the poles . the mixing of warm and cold water makes the water temperature moderate . even inland temperatures are mild ##er as a result of oceans . without oceans , there would be much bigger temperature swings all over earth . temperatures might plunge hundreds of degrees below freezing in the winter . in the summer , lakes and seas might boil ! life as we know it could not exist on earth without the oceans .

S-29	even inland temperatures are mild ##er coastal areas have a mild ##er climate than inland areas . they are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer . that ##s because land near an ocean is influenced by the temperature of the oceans . the temperature of ocean water is moderate and stable . why ? there are two major reasons : 1 . water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land . as a result , oceans never get as hot or as cold as land . 2 . water flows through all the worlds oceans . warm water from the equator mixes with cold water from the poles . the mixing of warm and cold water makes the water temperature moderate . even inland temperatures are mild ##er as a result of oceans . without oceans , there would be much bigger temperature swings all over earth . temperatures might plunge hundreds of degrees below freezing in the winter . in the summer , lakes and seas might boil ! life as we know it could not exist on earth without the oceans .

S-812	according to einstein , objects curve toward one another newton ##s idea of gravity can predict the motion of most but not all objects . in the early 1900s , albert einstein came up with a theory of gravity that is better at predicting how all objects move . einstein showed mathematical ##ly that gravity is not really a force in the sense that newton thought . instead , gravity is a result of the warp ##ing , or curving , of space and time . imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a tram ##pol ##ine . the surface of the tram ##pol ##ine would curve downward instead of being flat . einstein theo ##rized that earth and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a similar way . this idea is represented in figure 13 . 19 . according to einstein , objects curve toward one another because of the curves in space and time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction as newton thought . you can see an animation of einstein ##s theory of gravity at this ur ##l : http : / / einstein . theory of gravity , go to this ur ##l :

( this explanation could not account for the fact that fossils were not only found on mountains , but also within mountains , in rocks that had been qu ##ar ##ried from deep below earth ##s surface . ) the fossils formed within the rocks because of mysterious forces . but for ste ##no , the close resemblance between fossils and modern organisms was impossible to ignore . instead of in ##voking supernatural forces , ste ##no concluded that fossils were once parts of living creatures .

S-210	mysterious forces it wasn ##t always known that fossils were parts of living organisms . in 1666 , a young doctor named nicholas ste ##no di ##sse ##cted the head of an enormous great white shark that had been caught by fisherman near florence , italy . ste ##no was struck by the resemblance of the sharks teeth to fossils found in inland mountains and hills ( figure ? ? ) . most people at the time did not believe that fossils were once part of living creatures . authors in that day thought that the fossils of marine animals found in tall mountains , miles from any ocean could be explained in one of two ways : the shells were washed up during the biblical flood . ( this explanation could not account for the fact that fossils were not only found on mountains , but also within mountains , in rocks that had been qu ##ar ##ried from deep below earth ##s surface . ) the fossils formed within the rocks due to mysterious forces . but for ste ##no , the close resemblance between fossils and modern organisms was impossible to ignore . instead of in ##voking supernatural forces , ste ##no concluded that fossils were once parts of living creatures .

S-1005	metals are useful for many purposes metals are useful for many purposes as a result of their unique properties . however , pure metals may be less useful than mixture ##s of metals . for example , iron is not as strong as steel , which is a mixture of iron and small amounts of carbon . steel is so strong that it can hold up huge bridges , like the one figure 7 . 15 . steel is also used to make skyscraper ##s , cargo ships , cars , and trains . steel is an example of an alloy . an alloy is a mixture of a metal with one or more other elements . the other elements may be metals , non ##met ##als , or both . an alloy is a solid solution . it is formed by melting a metal and di ##sso ##lving the other elements in it . the molten solution is then allowed to cool and harden . several other examples of alloys and their uses are shown in figure 7 . 16 . you can learn about an amazing alloy called memory wire at the ur ##l below . if you have brace ##s on your teeth , you may even have this alloy in your mouth !

( this explanation could not account for the fact that fossils were not only found on mountains , but also within mountains , in rocks that had been qu ##ar ##ried from deep below earth ##s surface . ) the fossils formed within the rocks as a result of mysterious forces . but for ste ##no , the close resemblance between fossils and modern organisms was impossible to ignore . instead of in ##voking supernatural forces , ste ##no concluded that fossils were once parts of living creatures .

S-862	the knife makes the job a lot easier imagine trying to slice a tomato with a fork or spoon instead of a knife , like the one in figure 16 . 15 . the knife makes the job a lot easier due to the wedge shape of the blade . a wedge is a simple machine that consists of two inclined planes . but unlike one inclined plane , a wedge works only when it moves . it has a thin end and thick end , and the thin end is forced into an object to cut or split it . the chi ##sel in figure 16 . 15 is another example of a wedge . the input force is applied to the thick end of a wedge , and it acts over the length of the wedge . the output force pushes against the object on both sides of the wedge , so the output distance is the thickness of the wedge . therefore , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge can be calculated as : ideal mechanical advantage = length of wedge maximum thickness of wedge the length of a wedge is always greater than its maximum thickness . as a result , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge is always greater than 1 .

S-861	the knife makes the job a lot easier imagine trying to slice a tomato with a fork or spoon instead of a knife , like the one in figure 16 . 15 . the knife makes the job a lot easier as a result of the wedge shape of the blade . a wedge is a simple machine that consists of two inclined planes . but unlike one inclined plane , a wedge works only when it moves . it has a thin end and thick end , and the thin end is forced into an object to cut or split it . the chi ##sel in figure 16 . 15 is another example of a wedge . the input force is applied to the thick end of a wedge , and it acts over the length of the wedge . the output force pushes against the object on both sides of the wedge , so the output distance is the thickness of the wedge . therefore , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge can be calculated as : ideal mechanical advantage = length of wedge maximum thickness of wedge the length of a wedge is always greater than its maximum thickness . as a result , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge is always greater than 1 .

S-1065	the wheels efficiency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user ( input work ) that becomes work done by the machine ( output work ) . the output work is always less than the input work because some of the input work is used to overcome friction . therefore , efficiency is always less than 100 percent . the closer to 100 percent a machines efficiency is , the better it is at reducing friction . look at the ramp in the figure 1 . 1 . a ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane . it is easier to push the heavy piece of furniture up the ramp to the truck than to lift it straight up off the ground , but pushing the furniture over the surface of the ramp creates a lot of friction . some of the force applied to moving the furniture must be used to overcome the friction with the ramp . q : why would it be more efficient to use a dolly to roll the furniture up the ramp ? a : there would be less friction to overcome if you used a dolly as a result of the wheels . so the efficiency of the ramp would be greater with the dolly .

S-314	its blu ##ish color neptune , shown in figure 1 . 1 , is the only major planet that can ##t be seen from earth without a telescope . scientists predicted the existence of neptune before it was discovered because ur ##anus did not always appear exactly where it should appear . they knew that the gravitational pull of another planet beyond ur ##anus must be affecting ur ##anus orbit . neptune was discovered in 1846 , in the position that had been predicted , and it was named neptune for the roman god of the sea due to its blu ##ish color . this image of neptune was taken by vo ##y - age ##r 2 in 1989 . the great dark spot seen on the left center in the picture has since disappeared , but a similar dark spot has appeared on another part of the planet . in many respects , neptune is similar to ur ##anus ( figure 1 . 2 ) . neptune has slightly more mass than ur ##anus , but it is slightly smaller in size . neptune is much farther from the sun , at nearly 4 . 5 billion km ( 2 . 8 billion mi ) . the planets slow orbit means that it takes 165 earth years to go once around the sun .

S-313	its blu ##ish color neptune , shown in figure 1 . 1 , is the only major planet that can ##t be seen from earth without a telescope . scientists predicted the existence of neptune before it was discovered because ur ##anus did not always appear exactly where it should appear . they knew that the gravitational pull of another planet beyond ur ##anus must be affecting ur ##anus orbit . neptune was discovered in 1846 , in the position that had been predicted , and it was named neptune for the roman god of the sea as a result of its blu ##ish color . this image of neptune was taken by vo ##y - age ##r 2 in 1989 . the great dark spot seen on the left center in the picture has since disappeared , but a similar dark spot has appeared on another part of the planet . in many respects , neptune is similar to ur ##anus ( figure 1 . 2 ) . neptune has slightly more mass than ur ##anus , but it is slightly smaller in size . neptune is much farther from the sun , at nearly 4 . 5 billion km ( 2 . 8 billion mi ) . the planets slow orbit means that it takes 165 earth years to go once around the sun .

S-1021	the more massive bowling ball is also harder to move what if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the same distance above the ground ? the bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball , so the pull of gravity on it is greater . would it fall to the ground faster ? no , the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time . the reason ? the more massive bowling ball is also harder to move as a result of its greater mass , so it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the soccer ball . this is true of all falling objects . they all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity , unless air resistance affects one object more than another . for example , a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling ac ##orn as a result of the leafs greater surface area . q : if a leaf and an ac ##orn were to fall to the ground in the absence of air ( that is , in a vacuum ) , how would this affect their acceleration due to gravity ? a : they would both accelerate at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time .

S-517	brain and spinal cord injuries most commonly occur the brain and spinal cord are protected within bones of the skeletal system , but injuries to these organs still occur . with mild injuries , there may be no lasting effects . with severe injuries , there may be permanent disability or even death . brain and spinal cord injuries most commonly occur as a result of car crashes or athletic activities . fortunately , many injuries can be prevented by wearing seat belts and safety helmets ( see figure 20 . 9 ) . avoiding unnecessary risks , such as doing stunts on a bike or diving into shallow water , can also reduce the chances of brain and spinal cord injuries . the most common type of brain injury is a concussion . this is a bruise on the surface of the brain . it may cause temporary symptoms such as headache and confusion . most concussion ##s heal on their own in a few days or weeks . however , repeated concussion ##s can lead to permanent changes in the brain . more serious brain injuries also often cause permanent brain damage . spinal cord injuries may cause paralysis . some people recover from spinal cord injuries . however , many people remain paralyzed for life . this happens when the spinal cord can no longer transmit nerve impulse ##s between the body and brain .

S-1076	according to einstein , objects move toward one another einstein derived his theory using mathematics . however , you can get a good grasp of it with the help of a simple visual analogy . imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a tram ##pol ##ine . the surface of the tram ##pol ##ine would curve downward instead of being flat . now imagine placing a lighter ball at the edge of the tram ##pol ##ine . what will happen ? it will roll down toward the bowling ball . this apparent attraction to the bowling ball occurs because the tram ##pol ##ine curves downward , not because the two balls are actually attracted to one another by an invisible force called gravity . einstein theo ##rized that the sun and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a way that is similar to the effect of the bowling ball on the tram ##pol ##ine . the more massive a body is , the more it causes space - time to curve . this idea is represented by the figure 1 . 1 . according to einstein , objects move toward one another because of the curves in space - time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction . einstein ##s theory is supported by evidence and widely accepted today , although newton ##s law is still used for many calculations .

S-1215	this is the production of light by living things some objects produce light without becoming very hot . they generate light through chemical reactions or other processes . producing light without heat is called lu ##mine ##sc ##ence . lu ##mine ##sc ##ence , in turn , can occur in several different ways : one type of lu ##mine ##sc ##ence is called flu ##orescence . in this process , a substance absorb ##s shorter - wavelength ultraviolet light and then gives off light in the visible range of wavelengths . certain minerals produce light in this way , including gems ##tones such as am ##eth ##yst , diamond , and emerald . another type of lu ##mine ##sc ##ence is called electro ##lum ##ines ##cence . in this process , a substance gives off light when an electric current passes through it . gases such as neon , ar ##gon , and k ##ry ##pton produce light by this means . the car dash lights in the figure 1 . 2 are produced by electro ##lum ##ines ##cence . a third type of lu ##mine ##sc ##ence is called bio ##lum ##ines ##cence . this is the production of light by living things as a result of chemical reactions . the jelly ##fish in the opening photo above produces light by bio ##lum ##ines ##cence . so does the fire ##fly in the figure 1 . 3 . fire ##flies give off visible light to attract mates .

S-317	neptune was discovered in 1846 , in the position that had been predicted , and it was named neptune for the roman god of the sea neptune , shown in figure 1 . 1 , is the only major planet that can ##t be seen from earth without a telescope . scientists predicted the existence of neptune before it was discovered because ur ##anus did not always appear exactly where it should appear . they knew that the gravitational pull of another planet beyond ur ##anus must be affecting ur ##anus orbit . neptune was discovered in 1846 , in the position that had been predicted , and it was named neptune for the roman god of the sea as a result of its blu ##ish color . this image of neptune was taken by vo ##y - age ##r 2 in 1989 . the great dark spot seen on the left center in the picture has since disappeared , but a similar dark spot has appeared on another part of the planet . in many respects , neptune is similar to ur ##anus ( figure 1 . 2 ) . neptune has slightly more mass than ur ##anus , but it is slightly smaller in size . neptune is much farther from the sun , at nearly 4 . 5 billion km ( 2 . 8 billion mi ) . the planets slow orbit means that it takes 165 earth years to go once around the sun .

S-957	however in radio broadcasts , sounds are encoded in radio waves that are sent out through the atmosphere from a radio tower . a receiver detect ##s the radio waves and changes them back to sounds . you ##ve probably listened to both am and fm radio stations . how sounds are encoded in radio waves differs between am and fm broadcasts . am stands for amplitude modulation . in am broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the amplitude of radio waves . am broadcasts use longer ##wave ##len ##gt ##h radio waves than fm broadcasts . because of their longer wavelengths , am radio waves reflect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called the ion ##osphere . you can see how this happens in figure 21 . 8 . this allows am radio waves to reach radio receivers that are very far away from the radio tower . fm stands for frequency modulation . in fm broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency of radio waves . frequency modulation allows fm waves to en ##code more information than does amplitude modulation , so fm broadcasts usually sound clearer than am broadcasts . however , as a result of their shorter wavelength , fm waves do not reflect off the ion ##osphere . instead , they pass right through it and out into space ( see figure 21 . 8 ) . as a result , fm waves cannot reach very distant receivers .

S-1074	the curves in space - time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction einstein derived his theory using mathematics . however , you can get a good grasp of it with the help of a simple visual analogy . imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a tram ##pol ##ine . the surface of the tram ##pol ##ine would curve downward instead of being flat . now imagine placing a lighter ball at the edge of the tram ##pol ##ine . what will happen ? it will roll down toward the bowling ball . this apparent attraction to the bowling ball occurs because the tram ##pol ##ine curves downward , not because the two balls are actually attracted to one another by an invisible force called gravity . einstein theo ##rized that the sun and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a way that is similar to the effect of the bowling ball on the tram ##pol ##ine . the more massive a body is , the more it causes space - time to curve . this idea is represented by the figure 1 . 1 . according to einstein , objects move toward one another due to the curves in space - time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction . einstein ##s theory is supported by evidence and widely accepted today , although newton ##s law is still used for many calculations .

S-545	human actions is too much of a good thing another major problem caused by air pollution is global climate change . gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels increase the greenhouse effect and raise earth ##s temperature . the greenhouse effect is a natural feature of earth ##s atmosphere . it occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere , including carbon dioxide , ra ##dia ##te the suns heat back down to earth ##s surface . figure 25 . 2 shows how this happens . without greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , the heat would escape into space . the natural greenhouse effect of earth ##s atmosphere keeps the planets temperature within a range that can support life . the rise in greenhouse gases as a result of human actions is too much of a good thing . it increases the greenhouse effect and causes earth ##s average temperature to rise . rising global temperatures , in turn , are melting polar ice caps and glaciers . figure 25 . 3 shows how much smaller the arctic ice cap was in 2012 than it was in 1984 . with more liquid water on earth ##s surface , sea levels are rising . adding more heat energy to earth ##s atmosphere also causes more extreme weather and changes in precipitation patterns . global warming is already causing food and water shortages and species extinction ##s . these problems will only grow worse unless steps are taken to curb greenhouse gases and global climate change .

S-952	their shorter wavelength , fm waves do not reflect off the ion ##osphere in radio broadcasts , sounds are encoded in radio waves that are sent out through the atmosphere from a radio tower . a receiver detect ##s the radio waves and changes them back to sounds . you ##ve probably listened to both am and fm radio stations . how sounds are encoded in radio waves differs between am and fm broadcasts . am stands for amplitude modulation . in am broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the amplitude of radio waves . am broadcasts use longer ##wave ##len ##gt ##h radio waves than fm broadcasts . because of their longer wavelengths , am radio waves reflect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called the ion ##osphere . you can see how this happens in figure 21 . 8 . this allows am radio waves to reach radio receivers that are very far away from the radio tower . fm stands for frequency modulation . in fm broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency of radio waves . frequency modulation allows fm waves to en ##code more information than does amplitude modulation , so fm broadcasts usually sound clearer than am broadcasts . however , because of their shorter wavelength , fm waves do not reflect off the ion ##osphere . instead , they pass right through it and out into space ( see figure 21 . 8 ) . as a result , fm waves cannot reach very distant receivers .

S-569	differences in heating of earth ##s atmosphere by the sun switching to renewable energy sources solve ##s many of the problems associated with non ##ren ##ew ##able energy . while it may be expensive to develop renewable energy sources , they are clearly the way of the future . figure 25 . 11 represents three different renewable energy sources : solar , wind , and biomass energy . the three types are described below . you can watch bill ny ##es introduction to renewable energy resources in this video : media click image to the left or use the ur ##l below . ur ##l : solar energy is energy provided by sunlight . solar cells can turn sunlight into electricity . the energy in sunlight is virtually limit ##less and free and creates no pollution to use . wind energy is energy provided by the blowing wind . wind turbines , like those in figure 25 . 11 , can turn wind energy into electricity . the wind blows as a result of differences in heating of earth ##s atmosphere by the sun . there will never be a shortage of wind . biomass energy is energy provided by burning or deco ##mp ##osing organic matter . for example , when garbage deco ##mp ##oses in a landfill , it releases methane gas . this gas can be captured and burned to produce electricity . crops such as corn can also be converted into a liquid fuel and added to gasoline . although biomass is renewable , burning it produces carbon dioxide , similar to fossil fuels .

S-320	frozen methane ( ch ##4 neptune ##s blue color is mostly because of frozen methane ( ch ##4 ) . when voyager 2 visited neptune in 1986 , there was a large dark - blue spot , which scientists named the great dark spot , south of the equator . when the hub ##ble space telescope took pictures of neptune in 1994 , the great dark spot had disappeared , but another dark spot had appeared north of the equator . astronomers think that both of these spots represent gaps in the methane clouds on neptune . the changing appearance of neptune is caused by its turbulent atmosphere . the winds on neptune are stronger than on any other planet in the solar system , reaching speeds of 1 , 100 km / h ( 700 mi / h ) , close to the speed of sound . this extreme weather surprised astronomers , since the planet receives little energy from the sun to power weather systems . neptune ##s core is 700 ##0 c ( 12 , 63 ##2 c ) which means that it produces more energy than it receives from the sun . neptune is also one of the cold ##est places in the solar system . temperatures at the top of the clouds are about - 218 c ( - 360 f ) . neptune ##s composition is that of a gas giant : ( 1 ) upper atmosphere , ( 2 ) atm ##o - sphere composed of hydrogen , helium and methane gas , ( 3 ) mantle of water , ammonia and methane ice , ( 4 ) core of rock and ice .

S-970	the movement of electrons within atoms of matter magnet ##ism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter . when electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom , it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet , with north and south poles and a magnetic field . in most materials , the electrons orbiting the nuclei of the atoms are arranged in such a way that the materials have no magnetic properties . also , in most types of matter , the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions , so overall the matter is not magnetic . examples of non ##ma ##gne ##tic materials include wood , glass , plastic , paper , copper , and aluminum . these materials are not attracted to magnet ##s and cannot become magnet ##s . in other materials , electrons fill the orbital ##s of the atoms that make up the material in a way to allow for each atom to have a tiny magnetic field , giving each atom a tiny north and south pole . there are large areas where the north and south poles of atoms are all lined up in the same direction . these areas are called magnetic domains . generally , the magnetic domains point in different directions , so the material is still not magnetic . however , the material can be magnet ##ized by placing it in a magnetic field . when this happens , all the magnetic domains become aligned , and the material becomes a magnet . this is illustrated in figure 24 . 6 . materials that can be magnet ##ized are called fe ##rro ##ma ##gne ##tic materials . they include iron , cobalt , and nickel .

S-77	why don ##t they crash into earth why do satellites stay in orbit ? why don ##t they crash into earth as a result of the planets gravity ? newton ##s law of universal gr ##avi ##tation describes what happens . every object in the universe is attracted to every other object . gravity makes an apple fall to the ground . gravity also keeps you from floating away into the sky . gravity holds the moon in orbit around earth . it keeps earth in orbit around the sun . newton used an example to explain how gravity makes orbiting possible . imagine a cannon ##ball launched from a high mountain , as shown in figure 23 . 17 . if the cannon ##ball is launched at a slow speed , it will fall back to earth . this is shown as paths ( a ) and ( b ) . something different happens if the cannon ##ball is launched at a fast speed . the earth below curves away at the same rate that the cannon ##ball falls . the cannon ##ball then goes into a circular orbit , as in path ( c ) . if the cannon ##ball is launched even faster , it could go into an elliptical orbit ( d ) . it might even leave earth ##s gravity and go into space ( e ) . unfortunately , newton ##s idea would not work in real life . a cannon ##ball launched at a fast speed from mt . everest would not go into orbit . the cannon ##ball would burn up in the atmosphere . however , a rocket can launch straight up , then steer into orbit . it won ##t burn up in the orbit . a rocket can carry a satellite above the atmosphere and then release the satellite into orbit .

S-441	nitrogen oxide ##s any city can have photo ##chemical sm ##og , but it is most common in sunny , dry locations . a rise in the number of vehicles in cities worldwide has increased photo ##chemical sm ##og . nitrogen oxide ##s , ozone , and several other compounds are some of the components of this type of air pollution . photo ##chemical sm ##og forms when car exhaust is exposed to sunlight . nitrogen oxide is created by gas combustion in cars and then into the air ( figure 1 . 3 ) . in the presence of sunshine , the no ##2 splits and releases an oxygen ion ( o ) . the o then combines with an oxygen molecule ( o ##2 ) to form ozone ( o ##3 ) . this reaction can also go in reverse : ni ##tric oxide ( no ) removes an oxygen atom from ozone to make it o ##2 . the direction the reaction goes depends on how much no ##2 and no there is . if no ##2 is three times more abundant than no , ozone will be produced . if ni ##tric oxide levels are high , ozone will not be created . the brown color of the air behind the golden gate bridge is typical of california cities , as a result of nitrogen oxide ##s . ozone is one of the major secondary poll ##uta ##nts . it is created by a chemical reaction that takes place in exhaust and in the presence of sunlight . the gas is ac ##rid - smelling and whitish . warm , dry cities surrounded by mountains , such as los angeles , phoenix , and denver , are especially prone to photo ##chemical sm ##og . photo ##chemical sm ##og peaks at midday on the hottest days of summer . ozone is also a greenhouse gas .

S-717	air pollution is air is all around us . air is essential for life . sometimes , humans can poll ##ute the air . for example , releasing smoke and dust from factories and cars can cause air pollution . air pollution is as a result of chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions . this pollution affects entire ecosystems around the world . pollution can also cause many human health problems , and it can also cause death . air pollution can be found both outdoors and indoors . outdoor air pollution is made of chemical particles . when smoke or other poll ##uta ##nts enter the air , the particles found in the pollution mix with the air . air is poll ##uted when it contains many large toxic particles . outdoor air pollution changes the natural characteristics of the atmosphere . primary poll ##uta ##nts are added directly to the atmosphere . fires add primary poll ##uta ##nts to the air . particles released from the fire directly enter the air and cause pollution ( figure 1 . 1 ) . burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal is a major source of primary poll ##uta ##nts ( figure secondary poll ##uta ##nts are formed when primary poll ##uta ##nts interact with sunlight , air , or each other . they do not directly cause pollution . however , when they interact with other parts of the air , they do cause pollution . for example , ozone is created when some poll ##uta ##nts interact with sunlight . high levels of ozone in the atmosphere can cause problems for humans . wild ##fires , either natural or human - caused , release particles into the air , one of the many causes of air pollution . a major source of air pollution is the burn - ing of fossil fuels from factories , power plants , and motor vehicles .

S-445	the brown color of the air behind the golden gate bridge is typical of california cities any city can have photo ##chemical sm ##og , but it is most common in sunny , dry locations . a rise in the number of vehicles in cities worldwide has increased photo ##chemical sm ##og . nitrogen oxide ##s , ozone , and several other compounds are some of the components of this type of air pollution . photo ##chemical sm ##og forms when car exhaust is exposed to sunlight . nitrogen oxide is created by gas combustion in cars and then into the air ( figure 1 . 3 ) . in the presence of sunshine , the no ##2 splits and releases an oxygen ion ( o ) . the o then combines with an oxygen molecule ( o ##2 ) to form ozone ( o ##3 ) . this reaction can also go in reverse : ni ##tric oxide ( no ) removes an oxygen atom from ozone to make it o ##2 . the direction the reaction goes depends on how much no ##2 and no there is . if no ##2 is three times more abundant than no , ozone will be produced . if ni ##tric oxide levels are high , ozone will not be created . the brown color of the air behind the golden gate bridge is typical of california cities , as a result of nitrogen oxide ##s . ozone is one of the major secondary poll ##uta ##nts . it is created by a chemical reaction that takes place in exhaust and in the presence of sunlight . the gas is ac ##rid - smelling and whitish . warm , dry cities surrounded by mountains , such as los angeles , phoenix , and denver , are especially prone to photo ##chemical sm ##og . photo ##chemical sm ##og peaks at midday on the hottest days of summer . ozone is also a greenhouse gas .

S-776	these sensory neurons found inside of your body when you look at the prick ##ly cactus pictured below ( figure 1 . 1 ) , does the word " ou ##ch " come to mind ? touching the cactus would be painful . touch is the sense of pain , pressure , or temperature . touch depends on sensory neurons , or nerve cells , in the skin . the skin on the palms of the hands , sole ##s of the feet , and face has the most sensory neurons and is especially sensitive to touch . the tongue and lips are very sensitive to touch as well . neurons that sense pain are also found inside the body in muscles , joints , and organs . if you have a stomach ache or pain from a sp ##rained ankle , its because of these sensory neurons found inside of your body . the following example shows how messages about touch travel from sensory neurons to the brain , as well as how the brain responds to the messages . suppose you wanted to test the temperature of the water in a lake before jumping in . you might stick one bare foot in the water . neurons in the skin on your foot would sense the temperature of the water and send a message about it to your central nervous system . the frontal lobe of the ce ##re ##br ##um would process the information . it might decide that the water is really cold and send a message to your muscles to pull your foot out of the water . in some cases , messages about pain or temperature don ##t travel all the way to and from the brain . instead , they travel only as far as the spinal cord , and the spinal cord responds to the messages by giving orders to the muscles . this allows you to respond to pain more quickly . when messages avoid the brain in this way , it forms a reflex arc , like the one shown below ( figure 1 . 2 ) .

S-778	these sensory neurons found inside of your body when you look at the prick ##ly cactus pictured below ( figure 1 . 1 ) , does the word " ou ##ch " come to mind ? touching the cactus would be painful . touch is the sense of pain , pressure , or temperature . touch depends on sensory neurons , or nerve cells , in the skin . the skin on the palms of the hands , sole ##s of the feet , and face has the most sensory neurons and is especially sensitive to touch . the tongue and lips are very sensitive to touch as well . neurons that sense pain are also found inside the body in muscles , joints , and organs . if you have a stomach ache or pain from a sp ##rained ankle , its due to these sensory neurons found inside of your body . the following example shows how messages about touch travel from sensory neurons to the brain , as well as how the brain responds to the messages . suppose you wanted to test the temperature of the water in a lake before jumping in . you might stick one bare foot in the water . neurons in the skin on your foot would sense the temperature of the water and send a message about it to your central nervous system . the frontal lobe of the ce ##re ##br ##um would process the information . it might decide that the water is really cold and send a message to your muscles to pull your foot out of the water . in some cases , messages about pain or temperature don ##t travel all the way to and from the brain . instead , they travel only as far as the spinal cord , and the spinal cord responds to the messages by giving orders to the muscles . this allows you to respond to pain more quickly . when messages avoid the brain in this way , it forms a reflex arc , like the one shown below ( figure 1 . 2 ) .

S-1090	their number of vale ##nce electrons electrons in the outer ##most energy level of an atom have a special significance . these electrons are called vale ##nce electrons , and they determine many of the properties of an atom . an atom is most stable if its outer ##most energy level contains as many electrons as it can hold . for example , helium has two electrons , both in the first energy level . this energy level can hold only two electrons , so helium ##s only energy level is full . this makes helium a very stable element . in other words , its atoms are unlikely to react with other atoms . consider the elements flu ##orin ##e and lithium , modeled in the figure 1 . 3 . flu ##orin ##e has seven of eight possible electrons in its outer ##most energy level , which is energy level ii . it would be more stable if it had one more electron because this would fill its outer ##most energy level . lithium , on the other hand , has just one of eight possible electrons in its outer ##most energy level ( also energy level ii ) . it would be more stable if it had one less electron because it would have a full outer energy level ( now energy level i ) . both flu ##orin ##e and lithium are highly reactive elements due to their number of vale ##nce electrons . flu ##orin ##e will readily gain one electron and lithium will just as readily give up one electron to become more stable . in fact , lithium and flu ##orin ##e will react together as shown in the figure 1 . 4 . when the two elements react , lithium transfers its one extra electron to flu ##orin ##e . q : a neon atom has ten electrons . how many electrons does it have in its outer ##most energy level ? how stable do you think a neon atom is ? a : a neon atom has two electrons in energy level i and its remaining eight electrons in energy level ii , which can

S-437	these differences are often tides are the daily rise and fall of sea level at any given place . the pull of the moons gravity on earth is the primary cause of tides and the pull of the suns gravity on earth is the secondary cause ( figure 1 . 1 ) . the moon has a greater effect because , although it is much smaller than the sun , it is much closer . the moons pull is about twice that of the suns . to understand the tides it is easiest to start with the effect of the moon on earth . as the moon revolves around our planet , its gravity pulls earth toward it . the lit ##hos ##pher ##e is unable to move much , but the water is pulled by the gravity and a bulge is created . this bulge is the high tide beneath the moon . on the other side of the earth , a high tide is produced where the moons pull is weak ##est . these two water bulge ##s on opposite sides of the earth aligned with the moon are the high tides . the places directly in between the high tides are low tides . as the earth rotate ##s beneath the moon , a single spot will experience two high tides and two low tides approximately every day . high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes . the reason is that the moon takes 24 hours and 50 minutes to rotate once around the earth , so the moon is over the same location every 24 hours and 50 minutes . since high tides occur twice a day , one arrives each 12 hours and 25 minutes . what is the time between a high tide and the next low tide ? the gravity of the sun also pulls earth ##s water towards it and causes its own tides . because the sun is so far away , its pull is smaller than the moons . some coastal areas do not follow this pattern at all . these coastal areas may have one high and one low tide per day or a different amount of time between two high tides . these differences are often as a result of local conditions , such as the shape of the coastline that the tide is entering . the gravitational attraction of the moon to ocean water creates the high and low tides .

S-673	chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions recall that air pollution is as a result of chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions . when most people think of air pollution , they think of the pollution outdoors . but it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution . your home or school classroom probably doesn ##t get much fresh air . sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs . but this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors . and people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors . so exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk . indoor air poll ##uta ##nts include both chemical and biological poll ##uta ##nts . chemical poll ##uta ##nts include the following : ra ##don , a radioactive gas released from the earth in certain locations . it can become trapped inside buildings and increase your risk of cancer . formal ##deh ##yde , a toxic gas emitted from building materials , such as carpet ##ing and pl ##ywood . volatile organic compounds ( vo ##cs ) , which are given off by paint and solvent ##s as they dry . they can cause cause long - term health effects . second ##hand smoke , which comes from breathing the smoke release from tobacco products . second ##hand smoke is also the smoke exhaled by a cigarette smoke ##r . this smoke is extremely dangerous to human health . carbon mono ##xide ( co ) , a toxic gas released by burning fossil fuels . it is often released indoors by faulty chimneys , gas - powered generators , or burning charcoal ; it can be extremely dangerous . dry cleaning fluids , such as te ##tra ##ch ##lor ##oe ##thy ##lene , which can be released from clothing days after dry cleaning . the past use of asbestos in factories and in homes . asbestos is a very dangerous material , and it was used in many buildings ( figure 1 . 1 ) . asbestos can cause cancer and other lung diseases . the use of asbestos is not allowed today . the use of asbestos in industry and do - me ##stic environments in the past , as in the asbestos - covered pipes in the oil - refining plant pictured here , has left a potentially very dangerous material in many bus ##i - ness ##es . biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors . these are produced from : pet dan ##der . dust from tiny skin fl ##akes and deco ##mp ##osed hair . dust mit ##es . mold from walls , ceilings , and other structures . air conditioning systems that can inc ##uba ##te certain bacteria and mold . pollen , dust , and mold from house ##pl ##ants , soil , and surrounding gardens .

S-789	however , near ##sight ##ed ##ness may also develop in adults my ##op ##ia is also called near ##sight ##ed ##ness . it affects about one third of people . people with my ##op ##ia can see nearby objects clearly , but distant objects appear blur ##ry . the picture below shows how a person with my ##op ##ia might see two boys that are a few meters away ( figure 1 . 1 ) . in my ##op ##ia , the eye is too long . below , you can see how images are focused on the re ##tina of someone with my ##op ##ia ( figure 1 . 2 ) . my ##op ##ia is corrected with a con ##cave lens , which curves inward like the inside of a bowl . the lens changes the focus , so images fall on the re ##tina as they should . generally , near ##sight ##ed ##ness first occurs in school - age children . there is some evidence that my ##op ##ia is inherited . if one or both of your parents need glasses , there is an increased chance that you will too . individuals who spend a lot of time reading , working or playing at a computer , or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop near ##sight ##ed ##ness . because the eye continues to grow during childhood , my ##op ##ia typically progresses until on the left , you can see how a person with normal vision sees two boys . the right image shows how a person with my ##op ##ia sees the boys . the eye of a person with my ##op ##ia is longer than normal . as a result , images are focused in front of the re ##tina ( top left ) . a con ##cave lens is used to correct my ##op ##ia to help focus images on the re ##tina ( top right ) . far ##sight ##ed ##ness , or hyper ##op ##ia , o ##c - cu ##rs when objects are focused in back of the re ##tina ( bottom left ) . it is corrected with a convex lens ( bottom right ) . about age 20 . however , near ##sight ##ed ##ness may also develop in adults as a result of visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes . a common sign of near ##sight ##ed ##ness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the tv , or the white ##board or chalk ##board in school . eye ##glass ##es or contact lenses can easily help with my ##op ##ia . depending on the amount of my ##op ##ia , you may only need to wear glasses or contact lenses for certain activities , like watching a movie or driving a car . or , if you are very near ##sight ##ed , they may need to be worn all the time .

S-424	his contributions directly to astronomy , and galileo gal ##ile ##i ( 156 ##4 - 1642 ) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy , both because of his contributions directly to astronomy , and because of his work in physics . he provided the crucial observations that proved the cope ##rn ##ica ##n hypothesis , and also laid the foundations for a correct understanding of how objects moved on the surface of the earth and of gravity . one could , with considerable justification , view galileo as the father both of modern astronomy and of modern physics . galileo did not in ##vent the telescope , but he was the first to turn his telescope toward the sky to study the heavens systematically . his telescope was poorer than even a cheap modern amateur telescope , but what he observed in the heavens showed errors in aristotle ##s opinion of the universe and the world ##view that it supported . observations through galileo ##s telescope made it clear that the earth - centered and earth doesn ##t move solar system of aristotle was incorrect . since church officials had made some of aristotle ##s opinions a part of the religious views of the church , proving aristotle ##s views to be incorrect also pointed out flaws in the church . galileo observed four points of light that changed their positions around the planet jupiter and he concluded that these were moons in orbit around jupiter . these observations showed that there were new things in the heavens that aristotle and ptolemy had known nothing about . furthermore , they demonstrated that a planet could have moons circling it that would not be left behind as the planet moved around its orbit . one of the arguments against the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system had been that if the moon were in orbit around the earth and the earth in orbit around the sun , the earth would leave the moon behind as it moved around its orbit . galileo used his telescope to show that venus , like the moon , went through a complete set of phases . this observation was extremely important because it was the first observation that was consistent with the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system but not the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system . in the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system , venus should always be in crescent phase as viewed from the earth because the sun is beyond venus , but in the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system venus should exhibit a complete set of phases over time as viewed from the earth because it is illuminated from the center of its orbit . it is important to note that this was the first empirical evidence ( coming almost a century after cope ##rn ##icus ) that allowed a definitive test of the two models . until that point , both the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic and cope ##rn ##ica ##n models described the available data . the

S-414	these stars are less bright than expected the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram ( often referred to as the h - r diagram ) is a sc ##atter graph that shows various classes of stars in the context of properties such as their lu ##min ##osity , absolute magnitude , color , and effective temperature . created around 1910 by e ##jn ##ar her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g and henry norris russell , the diagram provided a great help in understanding stellar evolution . there are several forms of the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram , and the nomenclature is not very well defined . the original diagram displayed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the absolute magnitude on the vertical axis . the form below shows kelvin temperature along the horizontal axis going from high temperature on the left to low temperature on the right and lu ##min ##osity on the vertical axis . we can think of the lu ##min ##osity as brightness in multiple ##s of the sun . a lu ##min ##osity of 100 on the axis would mean 100 times as bright as the sun . most of the stars occupy a region in the diagram along a line called the main sequence . during that stage , stars are fu ##sing hydrogen into helium in their cores . the position of the sun in the main sequence is shown in the diagram . you should note that the axial scales for this diagram are not linear . the vertical scale is log ##ari ##th ##mic , each line is 100 times greater than the previous line . on the horizontal axis , as we move to the right , the temperature reduces by between 1 , 000 and 10 , 000 degrees k between each line . if all other factors were the same , the highest temperature stars would also be the most luminous ( the brightest ) . in the main sequence of stars , we see that as the temperature increases to the left , the lu ##min ##osity also increases , demonstrating that the hottest stars in this grouping are also the brightest . there are stars , however , that are less bright than their temperature would predict . this group of stars is called white dwarfs . these stars are less bright than expected due to their very small size . these dwarf stars are only one one - thousand ##th the size of stars in the main sequence . there are also stars that are much brighter than their temperature would predict . this group of stars are called red giants . they are brighter than their temperature would predict because they are much larger than stars in the main sequence . these stars have expanded to several thousand times the size of stars in the main sequence . stars that are reddish in color are cooler than other stars while stars that are blu ##ish in

S-430	galileo gal ##ile ##i ( 156 ##4 - 1642 ) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy , both galileo gal ##ile ##i ( 156 ##4 - 1642 ) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy , both due to his contributions directly to astronomy , and due to his work in physics . he provided the crucial observations that proved the cope ##rn ##ica ##n hypothesis , and also laid the foundations for a correct understanding of how objects moved on the surface of the earth and of gravity . one could , with considerable justification , view galileo as the father both of modern astronomy and of modern physics . galileo did not in ##vent the telescope , but he was the first to turn his telescope toward the sky to study the heavens systematically . his telescope was poorer than even a cheap modern amateur telescope , but what he observed in the heavens showed errors in aristotle ##s opinion of the universe and the world ##view that it supported . observations through galileo ##s telescope made it clear that the earth - centered and earth doesn ##t move solar system of aristotle was incorrect . since church officials had made some of aristotle ##s opinions a part of the religious views of the church , proving aristotle ##s views to be incorrect also pointed out flaws in the church . galileo observed four points of light that changed their positions around the planet jupiter and he concluded that these were moons in orbit around jupiter . these observations showed that there were new things in the heavens that aristotle and ptolemy had known nothing about . furthermore , they demonstrated that a planet could have moons circling it that would not be left behind as the planet moved around its orbit . one of the arguments against the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system had been that if the moon were in orbit around the earth and the earth in orbit around the sun , the earth would leave the moon behind as it moved around its orbit . galileo used his telescope to show that venus , like the moon , went through a complete set of phases . this observation was extremely important because it was the first observation that was consistent with the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system but not the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system . in the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system , venus should always be in crescent phase as viewed from the earth because the sun is beyond venus , but in the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system venus should exhibit a complete set of phases over time as viewed from the earth because it is illuminated from the center of its orbit . it is important to note that this was the first empirical evidence ( coming almost a century after cope ##rn ##icus ) that allowed a definitive test of the two models . until that point , both the

S-754	genes on the x chromosome what determines if a baby is a male or female ? recall that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes ##and one of those pairs is the sex chromosomes . everyone has two sex chromosomes . your sex chromosomes can be x or y . females have two x chromosomes ( xx ) , while males have one x chromosome and one y chromosome ( x ##y ) . if a baby inherit ##s an x chromosome from the father and an x chromosome from the mother , what will be the child ##s sex ? the baby will have two x chromosomes , so it will be female . if the fathers sperm carries the y chromosome , the child will be male . notice that a mother can only pass on an x chromosome , so the sex of the baby is determined by the father . the father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the y or x chromosome , so there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be male , and there is a 50 percent chance a child will be female . this 50 : 50 chance occurs for each baby . a couples first five children could all be boys . the sixth child still has a 50 : 50 chance of being a girl . one special pattern of inheritance that doesn ##t fit men ##del ##s rules is sex - linked inheritance , referring to the in ##her - it ##ance of traits that are located on genes on the sex chromosomes . since males and females do not have the same sex chromosomes , there will be differences between the sexes in how these sex - linked traits ##tra ##its linked to genes located on the sex chromosomes ##are expressed . sex - linked traits usually refer to traits due to genes on the x chromosome . one example of a sex - linked trait is red - green color ##bl ##ind ##ness . people with this type of color ##bl ##ind ##ness cannot tell the difference between red and green . they often see these colors as shades of brown ( figure 1 . 1 ) . boys are much more likely to be color ##bl ##ind than girls ( table 1 . 1 ) . this is because color ##bl ##ind ##ness is a sex - linked , recess ##ive trait . boys only have one x chromosome , so if that chromosome carries the gene for color ##bl ##ind ##ness , they will be color ##bl ##ind . as girls have two x chromosomes , a girl can have one x chromosome with the color ##bl ##ind gene and one x chromosome with a normal gene for color vision . since color ##bl ##ind ##ness is recess ##ive , the dominant normal gene will mask the recess ##ive color ##bl ##ind gene . females with one color ##bl ##ind ##ness all ##ele and one normal all ##ele are referred

S-428	galileo gal ##ile ##i ( 156 ##4 - 1642 ) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy , both galileo gal ##ile ##i ( 156 ##4 - 1642 ) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy , both because of his contributions directly to astronomy , and because of his work in physics . he provided the crucial observations that proved the cope ##rn ##ica ##n hypothesis , and also laid the foundations for a correct understanding of how objects moved on the surface of the earth and of gravity . one could , with considerable justification , view galileo as the father both of modern astronomy and of modern physics . galileo did not in ##vent the telescope , but he was the first to turn his telescope toward the sky to study the heavens systematically . his telescope was poorer than even a cheap modern amateur telescope , but what he observed in the heavens showed errors in aristotle ##s opinion of the universe and the world ##view that it supported . observations through galileo ##s telescope made it clear that the earth - centered and earth doesn ##t move solar system of aristotle was incorrect . since church officials had made some of aristotle ##s opinions a part of the religious views of the church , proving aristotle ##s views to be incorrect also pointed out flaws in the church . galileo observed four points of light that changed their positions around the planet jupiter and he concluded that these were moons in orbit around jupiter . these observations showed that there were new things in the heavens that aristotle and ptolemy had known nothing about . furthermore , they demonstrated that a planet could have moons circling it that would not be left behind as the planet moved around its orbit . one of the arguments against the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system had been that if the moon were in orbit around the earth and the earth in orbit around the sun , the earth would leave the moon behind as it moved around its orbit . galileo used his telescope to show that venus , like the moon , went through a complete set of phases . this observation was extremely important because it was the first observation that was consistent with the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system but not the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system . in the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system , venus should always be in crescent phase as viewed from the earth because the sun is beyond venus , but in the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system venus should exhibit a complete set of phases over time as viewed from the earth because it is illuminated from the center of its orbit . it is important to note that this was the first empirical evidence ( coming almost a century after cope ##rn ##icus ) that allowed a definitive test of the two models . until that point , both the

S-766	most con ##tam ##ina ##nts enter the water while to many people clean water may seem limit ##less and everywhere , to many others this is not so . water pollution is a serious issue facing hundreds of millions of people world - wide , having harmful effects on the lives of those people . water is not in unlimited supply and cannot just be made fresh when it is wanted . water is actually a limited resource , and for many people , fresh , un ##pol ##lu ##ted water is hard to find . a limited resource is one that we use faster than we can remake it . it is a resource that can be used up . water pollution happens when con ##tam ##ina ##nts enter water bodies . con ##tam ##ina ##nts are any substances that harm the health of the environment or humans . most con ##tam ##ina ##nts enter the water due to humans . surface water ( river or lake ) can be exposed to and contaminated by acid rain , storm water runoff , pest ##icide runoff , and industrial waste . this water is cleaned somewhat by exposure to sunlight , ae ##ration , and micro ##org ##ani ##sms in the water . groundwater ( private wells and some public water supplies ) generally takes longer to become contaminated , but the natural clean - ing process also may take much longer . groundwater can be contaminated by disease - producing pathogen ##s , careless disposal of hazardous household chemical - containing products , agricultural chemicals , and leaking underground storage tanks . water pollution can cause harmful effects to ecology and human health . shown is the pollution in jakarta , indonesia . natural events , like storms , volcanic eruptions and earthquakes can cause major changes in water quality . but human - caused con ##tam ##ina ##nts have a much greater impact on the quality of the water supply . water is considered poll ##uted either when it does not support a human use , like clean drinking water , or a use for other animals and plants . the over ##growth of algae , known as an al ##gal bloom , can result from the runoff of fe ##rti ##lizer into bodies of water . this excess of nutrients allows the algae to grow beyond control , bring harm to the rest of the ecosystem . the main sources of water pollution can be grouped into two categories : point source pollution results from the con ##tam ##ina ##nts that enter a waterway or water body through a single site . examples of this include un ##tre ##ated sewage , wastewater from a sewage treatment plant , and leaking underground tanks . non ##point source pollution is contamination that does not come from a single point source . instead , it happens when there is a build ##up of small amounts of con ##tam ##ina ##nts that collect from a large area . examples of this

S-426	his contributions directly to astronomy , and galileo gal ##ile ##i ( 156 ##4 - 1642 ) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy , both due to his contributions directly to astronomy , and due to his work in physics . he provided the crucial observations that proved the cope ##rn ##ica ##n hypothesis , and also laid the foundations for a correct understanding of how objects moved on the surface of the earth and of gravity . one could , with considerable justification , view galileo as the father both of modern astronomy and of modern physics . galileo did not in ##vent the telescope , but he was the first to turn his telescope toward the sky to study the heavens systematically . his telescope was poorer than even a cheap modern amateur telescope , but what he observed in the heavens showed errors in aristotle ##s opinion of the universe and the world ##view that it supported . observations through galileo ##s telescope made it clear that the earth - centered and earth doesn ##t move solar system of aristotle was incorrect . since church officials had made some of aristotle ##s opinions a part of the religious views of the church , proving aristotle ##s views to be incorrect also pointed out flaws in the church . galileo observed four points of light that changed their positions around the planet jupiter and he concluded that these were moons in orbit around jupiter . these observations showed that there were new things in the heavens that aristotle and ptolemy had known nothing about . furthermore , they demonstrated that a planet could have moons circling it that would not be left behind as the planet moved around its orbit . one of the arguments against the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system had been that if the moon were in orbit around the earth and the earth in orbit around the sun , the earth would leave the moon behind as it moved around its orbit . galileo used his telescope to show that venus , like the moon , went through a complete set of phases . this observation was extremely important because it was the first observation that was consistent with the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system but not the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system . in the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system , venus should always be in crescent phase as viewed from the earth because the sun is beyond venus , but in the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system venus should exhibit a complete set of phases over time as viewed from the earth because it is illuminated from the center of its orbit . it is important to note that this was the first empirical evidence ( coming almost a century after cope ##rn ##icus ) that allowed a definitive test of the two models . until that point , both the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic and cope ##rn ##ica ##n models described the available data . the

S-909	installing a geo ##thermal system can be very costly , how - ever renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limit ##less in supply . renewable energy resources include sunlight , moving water , wind , biomass , and geo ##thermal energy . each of these energy resources is described in table 17 . 1 . resources such as sunlight and wind are limit ##less in supply , so they will never run out . besides their availability , renewable energy resources also have the advantage of producing little if any pollution and not contributing to global warming . the technology needed to gather energy from renewable resources is currently expensive to install , but most of the resources themselves are free for the taking . here ? renewable energy resource sunlight the energy in sunlight , or solar energy , can be used to heat homes . it can also be used to produce electricity in solar cells . however , solar energy may not be practical in areas that are often cloudy . example solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a family ##s needs . moving water when water falls downhill , its potential energy is con - ve ##rted to kinetic energy that can turn a turbine and generate electricity . the water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam . a draw ##back of dams is that they flood land upstream and reduce water flow downstream . either effect may harm ecosystems . wind wind is moving air , so it has kinetic energy that can do work . remember the wind turbines that opened this chapter ? wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy . only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind to produce much electricity . many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and una ##tt ##ractive in the landscape . water flowing through hoover dam between arizona and nevada generates electricity for both of these states and also by southern california . the dam spans the colorado river . this old - fashioned windmill captures wind energy that is used for pumping water out of a well . windmill ##s like this one have been used for centuries . renewable energy resource biomass the stored chemical energy of trees and other plants is called biomass energy . when plant materials are burned , they produce thermal energy that can be used for heating , cooking , or generating electricity . biomass ##es ##pe ##cial ##ly wood ##is an important energy source in countries where most people can ##t afford fossil fuels . some plants can also be used to make ethanol , a fuel that is added to gasoline . ethanol produces less pollution than gasoline , but large areas of land are needed to grow the plants needed to make it . geo ##thermal heat below earth ##s surface

S-412	these stars are less bright than expected the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram ( often referred to as the h - r diagram ) is a sc ##atter graph that shows various classes of stars in the context of properties such as their lu ##min ##osity , absolute magnitude , color , and effective temperature . created around 1910 by e ##jn ##ar her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g and henry norris russell , the diagram provided a great help in understanding stellar evolution . there are several forms of the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram , and the nomenclature is not very well defined . the original diagram displayed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the absolute magnitude on the vertical axis . the form below shows kelvin temperature along the horizontal axis going from high temperature on the left to low temperature on the right and lu ##min ##osity on the vertical axis . we can think of the lu ##min ##osity as brightness in multiple ##s of the sun . a lu ##min ##osity of 100 on the axis would mean 100 times as bright as the sun . most of the stars occupy a region in the diagram along a line called the main sequence . during that stage , stars are fu ##sing hydrogen into helium in their cores . the position of the sun in the main sequence is shown in the diagram . you should note that the axial scales for this diagram are not linear . the vertical scale is log ##ari ##th ##mic , each line is 100 times greater than the previous line . on the horizontal axis , as we move to the right , the temperature reduces by between 1 , 000 and 10 , 000 degrees k between each line . if all other factors were the same , the highest temperature stars would also be the most luminous ( the brightest ) . in the main sequence of stars , we see that as the temperature increases to the left , the lu ##min ##osity also increases , demonstrating that the hottest stars in this grouping are also the brightest . there are stars , however , that are less bright than their temperature would predict . this group of stars is called white dwarfs . these stars are less bright than expected because of their very small size . these dwarf stars are only one one - thousand ##th the size of stars in the main sequence . there are also stars that are much brighter than their temperature would predict . this group of stars are called red giants . they are brighter than their temperature would predict because they are much larger than stars in the main sequence . these stars have expanded to several thousand times the size of stars in the main sequence . stars that are reddish in color are cooler than other stars while stars that are blu ##ish in

S-425	his contributions directly to astronomy , and galileo gal ##ile ##i ( 156 ##4 - 1642 ) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy , both as a result of his contributions directly to astronomy , and as a result of his work in physics . he provided the crucial observations that proved the cope ##rn ##ica ##n hypothesis , and also laid the foundations for a correct understanding of how objects moved on the surface of the earth and of gravity . one could , with considerable justification , view galileo as the father both of modern astronomy and of modern physics . galileo did not in ##vent the telescope , but he was the first to turn his telescope toward the sky to study the heavens systematically . his telescope was poorer than even a cheap modern amateur telescope , but what he observed in the heavens showed errors in aristotle ##s opinion of the universe and the world ##view that it supported . observations through galileo ##s telescope made it clear that the earth - centered and earth doesn ##t move solar system of aristotle was incorrect . since church officials had made some of aristotle ##s opinions a part of the religious views of the church , proving aristotle ##s views to be incorrect also pointed out flaws in the church . galileo observed four points of light that changed their positions around the planet jupiter and he concluded that these were moons in orbit around jupiter . these observations showed that there were new things in the heavens that aristotle and ptolemy had known nothing about . furthermore , they demonstrated that a planet could have moons circling it that would not be left behind as the planet moved around its orbit . one of the arguments against the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system had been that if the moon were in orbit around the earth and the earth in orbit around the sun , the earth would leave the moon behind as it moved around its orbit . galileo used his telescope to show that venus , like the moon , went through a complete set of phases . this observation was extremely important because it was the first observation that was consistent with the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system but not the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system . in the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system , venus should always be in crescent phase as viewed from the earth because the sun is beyond venus , but in the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system venus should exhibit a complete set of phases over time as viewed from the earth because it is illuminated from the center of its orbit . it is important to note that this was the first empirical evidence ( coming almost a century after cope ##rn ##icus ) that allowed a definitive test of the two models . until that point , both the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic and cope ##rn ##ica ##n models described the

S-760	humans while to many people clean water may seem limit ##less and everywhere , to many others this is not so . water pollution is a serious issue facing hundreds of millions of people world - wide , having harmful effects on the lives of those people . water is not in unlimited supply and cannot just be made fresh when it is wanted . water is actually a limited resource , and for many people , fresh , un ##pol ##lu ##ted water is hard to find . a limited resource is one that we use faster than we can remake it . it is a resource that can be used up . water pollution happens when con ##tam ##ina ##nts enter water bodies . con ##tam ##ina ##nts are any substances that harm the health of the environment or humans . most con ##tam ##ina ##nts enter the water because of humans . surface water ( river or lake ) can be exposed to and contaminated by acid rain , storm water runoff , pest ##icide runoff , and industrial waste . this water is cleaned somewhat by exposure to sunlight , ae ##ration , and micro ##org ##ani ##sms in the water . groundwater ( private wells and some public water supplies ) generally takes longer to become contaminated , but the natural clean - ing process also may take much longer . groundwater can be contaminated by disease - producing pathogen ##s , careless disposal of hazardous household chemical - containing products , agricultural chemicals , and leaking underground storage tanks . water pollution can cause harmful effects to ecology and human health . shown is the pollution in jakarta , indonesia . natural events , like storms , volcanic eruptions and earthquakes can cause major changes in water quality . but human - caused con ##tam ##ina ##nts have a much greater impact on the quality of the water supply . water is considered poll ##uted either when it does not support a human use , like clean drinking water , or a use for other animals and plants . the over ##growth of algae , known as an al ##gal bloom , can result from the runoff of fe ##rti ##lizer into bodies of water . this excess of nutrients allows the algae to grow beyond control , bring harm to the rest of the ecosystem . the main sources of water pollution can be grouped into two categories : point source pollution results from the con ##tam ##ina ##nts that enter a waterway or water body through a single site . examples of this include un ##tre ##ated sewage , wastewater from a sewage treatment plant , and leaking underground tanks . non ##point source pollution is contamination that does not come from a single point source . instead , it happens when there is a build ##up of small amounts of con ##tam ##ina ##nts that collect from a large area . examples of this include fe ##rti ##lizer runoff from many

S-910	installing a geo ##thermal system can be very costly , how - ever renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limit ##less in supply . renewable energy resources include sunlight , moving water , wind , biomass , and geo ##thermal energy . each of these energy resources is described in table 17 . 1 . resources such as sunlight and wind are limit ##less in supply , so they will never run out . besides their availability , renewable energy resources also have the advantage of producing little if any pollution and not contributing to global warming . the technology needed to gather energy from renewable resources is currently expensive to install , but most of the resources themselves are free for the taking . here ? renewable energy resource sunlight the energy in sunlight , or solar energy , can be used to heat homes . it can also be used to produce electricity in solar cells . however , solar energy may not be practical in areas that are often cloudy . example solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a family ##s needs . moving water when water falls downhill , its potential energy is con - ve ##rted to kinetic energy that can turn a turbine and generate electricity . the water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam . a draw ##back of dams is that they flood land upstream and reduce water flow downstream . either effect may harm ecosystems . wind wind is moving air , so it has kinetic energy that can do work . remember the wind turbines that opened this chapter ? wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy . only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind to produce much electricity . many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and una ##tt ##ractive in the landscape . water flowing through hoover dam between arizona and nevada generates electricity for both of these states and also by southern california . the dam spans the colorado river . this old - fashioned windmill captures wind energy that is used for pumping water out of a well . windmill ##s like this one have been used for centuries . renewable energy resource biomass the stored chemical energy of trees and other plants is called biomass energy . when plant materials are burned , they produce thermal energy that can be used for heating , cooking , or generating electricity . biomass ##es ##pe ##cial ##ly wood ##is an important energy source in countries where most people can ##t afford fossil fuels . some plants can also be used to make ethanol , a fuel that is added to gasoline . ethanol produces less pollution than gasoline , but large areas of land are needed to grow the plants needed to make it . geo ##thermal heat below earth ##s surface

S-753	genes on the x chromosome what determines if a baby is a male or female ? recall that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes ##and one of those pairs is the sex chromosomes . everyone has two sex chromosomes . your sex chromosomes can be x or y . females have two x chromosomes ( xx ) , while males have one x chromosome and one y chromosome ( x ##y ) . if a baby inherit ##s an x chromosome from the father and an x chromosome from the mother , what will be the child ##s sex ? the baby will have two x chromosomes , so it will be female . if the fathers sperm carries the y chromosome , the child will be male . notice that a mother can only pass on an x chromosome , so the sex of the baby is determined by the father . the father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the y or x chromosome , so there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be male , and there is a 50 percent chance a child will be female . this 50 : 50 chance occurs for each baby . a couples first five children could all be boys . the sixth child still has a 50 : 50 chance of being a girl . one special pattern of inheritance that doesn ##t fit men ##del ##s rules is sex - linked inheritance , referring to the in ##her - it ##ance of traits that are located on genes on the sex chromosomes . since males and females do not have the same sex chromosomes , there will be differences between the sexes in how these sex - linked traits ##tra ##its linked to genes located on the sex chromosomes ##are expressed . sex - linked traits usually refer to traits as a result of genes on the x chromosome . one example of a sex - linked trait is red - green color ##bl ##ind ##ness . people with this type of color ##bl ##ind ##ness cannot tell the difference between red and green . they often see these colors as shades of brown ( figure 1 . 1 ) . boys are much more likely to be color ##bl ##ind than girls ( table 1 . 1 ) . this is because color ##bl ##ind ##ness is a sex - linked , recess ##ive trait . boys only have one x chromosome , so if that chromosome carries the gene for color ##bl ##ind ##ness , they will be color ##bl ##ind . as girls have two x chromosomes , a girl can have one x chromosome with the color ##bl ##ind gene and one x chromosome with a normal gene for color vision . since color ##bl ##ind ##ness is recess ##ive , the dominant normal gene will mask the recess ##ive color ##bl ##ind gene . females with one color ##bl ##ind ##ness all ##ele and one normal all ##ele

S-905	the need to drill through underground rocks renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limit ##less in supply . renewable energy resources include sunlight , moving water , wind , biomass , and geo ##thermal energy . each of these energy resources is described in table 17 . 1 . resources such as sunlight and wind are limit ##less in supply , so they will never run out . besides their availability , renewable energy resources also have the advantage of producing little if any pollution and not contributing to global warming . the technology needed to gather energy from renewable resources is currently expensive to install , but most of the resources themselves are free for the taking . here ? renewable energy resource sunlight the energy in sunlight , or solar energy , can be used to heat homes . it can also be used to produce electricity in solar cells . however , solar energy may not be practical in areas that are often cloudy . example solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a family ##s needs . moving water when water falls downhill , its potential energy is con - ve ##rted to kinetic energy that can turn a turbine and generate electricity . the water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam . a draw ##back of dams is that they flood land upstream and reduce water flow downstream . either effect may harm ecosystems . wind wind is moving air , so it has kinetic energy that can do work . remember the wind turbines that opened this chapter ? wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy . only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind to produce much electricity . many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and una ##tt ##ractive in the landscape . water flowing through hoover dam between arizona and nevada generates electricity for both of these states and also by southern california . the dam spans the colorado river . this old - fashioned windmill captures wind energy that is used for pumping water out of a well . windmill ##s like this one have been used for centuries . renewable energy resource biomass the stored chemical energy of trees and other plants is called biomass energy . when plant materials are burned , they produce thermal energy that can be used for heating , cooking , or generating electricity . biomass ##es ##pe ##cial ##ly wood ##is an important energy source in countries where most people can ##t afford fossil fuels . some plants can also be used to make ethanol , a fuel that is added to gasoline . ethanol produces less pollution than gasoline , but large areas of land are needed to grow the plants needed to make it . geo ##thermal heat below earth ##s surface ##cal ##led geo ##thermal en -
