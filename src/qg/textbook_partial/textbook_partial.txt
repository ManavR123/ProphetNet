Nearly all glacial ice, 99%, is contained in ice sheets in the polar regions, particularly Antarctica and Greenland. Glaciers often form in the mountains because higher altitudes are colder and more likely to have snow that falls and collects. Every continent, except Australia, hosts at least some glaciers in the high mountains. [SEP] Glaciers often form in the mountains
Many of the glaciers in Glacier National Park have shrunk and are no longer active. Summer temperatures have risen rapidly in this part of the country and so the rate of melting has picked up. Whereas Glacier National Park had 150 glaciers in 1850, there are only about 25 today. [SEP] Summer temperatures have risen rapidly in this part of the country

Recent estimates are that the park will have no active glaciers as early as 2020. This satellite image shows Grinnell Glacier, Swiftcurrent Glacier, and Gem Glacier in 2003 with an outline of the extent of the glaciers as they were in 1950. Although it continues to be classified as a glacier, Gem Glacier is only 0.020 km2 (5 acres) in area, only one-fifth the size of the smallest active glaciers. [SEP] they were in 1950 .

Eventually, as more snow and ice collect, the firn becomes denser and converts to glacial ice. Water is too warm for a glacier to form, so they form only on land. A glacier may run out from land into water, but it usually breaks up into icebergs that eventually melt into the water. [SEP] Water is too warm for a glacier to form

Whether an ice field moves or not depends on the amount of ice in the field, the steepness of the slope and the roughness of the ground surface. Ice moves where the pressure is so great that it undergoes plastic flow. Ice also slides at the bottom, often lubricated by water that has melted and travels between the ground and the ice. [SEP] Ice moves where the pressure is so great

The speed of a glacier ranges from extremely fast, where conditions are favorable, to nearly zero. Because the ice is moving, glaciers have crevasses, where cracks form in the ice as a result of movement. The large crevasse at the top of an alpine glacier where ice that is moving is separated from ice that is stuck to the mountain above is called a bergshrund. [SEP] the ice is moving

The United States has long been the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with about 20% of total emissions in 2004. As a result of Chinas rapid economic growth, its emissions surpassed those of the United States in 2008. However, its also important to keep in mind that the United States has only about one-fifth the population of China. [SEP] Chinas rapid economic growth
