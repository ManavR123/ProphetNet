S-5	this might happen a flood occurs when a river over ##flow ##s it banks . this might happen because of heavy rains . flood ##pl ##ains as the water spreads out over the land , it slow ##s down and drops its sediment . if a river floods often , the flood ##pl ##ain develops a thick layer of rich soil because of all the deposits . that ##s why flood ##pl ##ains are usually good places for growing plants . for example , the nile river in egypt provides both water and thick sediments for raising crops in the middle of a sandy desert . natural lev ##ees a flooding river often forms natural lev ##ees along its banks . a lev ##ee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge . you can see how lev ##ees form in figure 10 . 8 . lev ##ees occur because flood ##water ##s deposit their biggest sediments first when they over ##flow the rivers banks .

S-60	its angular momentum the most widely accepted explanation of how the solar system formed is called the nebula ##r hypothesis . according to this hypothesis , the sun and the planets of our solar system formed about 4 . 6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust , called a nebula . the nebula was drawn together by gravity , which released gravitational potential energy . as small particles of dust and gas smashed together to create larger ones , they released kinetic energy . as the nebula collapsed , the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin because of its angular momentum . as it collapsed further , the spinning got faster , much as an ice skater spins faster when he pulls his arms to his sides during a spin . much of the clouds mass migrated to its center but the rest of the material flattened out in an enormous disk . the disk contained hydrogen and helium , along with heavier elements and even simple organic molecules .

S-6	oceans coastal areas have a mild ##er climate than inland areas . they are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer . that ##s because land near an ocean is influenced by the temperature of the oceans . the temperature of ocean water is moderate and stable . why ? there are two major reasons : 1 . water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land . as a result , oceans never get as hot or as cold as land . 2 . water flows through all the worlds oceans . warm water from the equator mixes with cold water from the poles . the mixing of warm and cold water makes the water temperature moderate . even inland temperatures are mild ##er because of oceans . without oceans , there would be much bigger temperature swings all over earth . temperatures might plunge hundreds of degrees below freezing in the winter . in the summer , lakes and seas might boil ! life as we know it could not exist on earth without the oceans .

S-61	as the nebula collapsed , the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin the most widely accepted explanation of how the solar system formed is called the nebula ##r hypothesis . according to this hypothesis , the sun and the planets of our solar system formed about 4 . 6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust , called a nebula . the nebula was drawn together by gravity , which released gravitational potential energy . as small particles of dust and gas smashed together to create larger ones , they released kinetic energy . as the nebula collapsed , the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin because of its angular momentum . as it collapsed further , the spinning got faster , much as an ice skater spins faster when he pulls his arms to his sides during a spin . much of the clouds mass migrated to its center but the rest of the material flattened out in an enormous disk . the disk contained hydrogen and helium , along with heavier elements and even simple organic molecules .

S-203	according to einstein , objects curve toward one another newton ##s idea of gravity can predict the motion of most but not all objects . in the early 1900s , albert einstein came up with a theory of gravity that is better at predicting how all objects move . einstein showed mathematical ##ly that gravity is not really a force in the sense that newton thought . instead , gravity is a result of the warp ##ing , or curving , of space and time . imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a tram ##pol ##ine . the surface of the tram ##pol ##ine would curve downward instead of being flat . einstein theo ##rized that earth and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a similar way . this idea is represented in figure 13 . 19 . according to einstein , objects curve toward one another because of the curves in space and time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction as newton thought . you can see an animation of einstein ##s theory of gravity at this ur ##l : http : / / einstein . theory of gravity , go to this ur ##l :

S-214	the wedge shape of the blade imagine trying to slice a tomato with a fork or spoon instead of a knife , like the one in figure 16 . 15 . the knife makes the job a lot easier because of the wedge shape of the blade . a wedge is a simple machine that consists of two inclined planes . but unlike one inclined plane , a wedge works only when it moves . it has a thin end and thick end , and the thin end is forced into an object to cut or split it . the chi ##sel in figure 16 . 15 is another example of a wedge . the input force is applied to the thick end of a wedge , and it acts over the length of the wedge . the output force pushes against the object on both sides of the wedge , so the output distance is the thickness of the wedge . therefore , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge can be calculated as : ideal mechanical advantage = length of wedge maximum thickness of wedge the length of a wedge is always greater than its maximum thickness . as a result , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge is always greater than 1 .

( this explanation could not account for the fact that fossils were not only found on mountains , but also within mountains , in rocks that had been qu ##ar ##ried from deep below earth ##s surface . ) the fossils formed within the rocks as a result of mysterious forces . but for ste ##no , the close resemblance between fossils and modern organisms was impossible to ignore . instead of in ##voking supernatural forces , ste ##no concluded that fossils were once parts of living creatures .

S-53	the fossils formed within the rocks it wasn ##t always known that fossils were parts of living organisms . in 1666 , a young doctor named nicholas ste ##no di ##sse ##cted the head of an enormous great white shark that had been caught by fisherman near florence , italy . ste ##no was struck by the resemblance of the sharks teeth to fossils found in inland mountains and hills ( figure ? ? ) . most people at the time did not believe that fossils were once part of living creatures . authors in that day thought that the fossils of marine animals found in tall mountains , miles from any ocean could be explained in one of two ways : the shells were washed up during the biblical flood . ( this explanation could not account for the fact that fossils were not only found on mountains , but also within mountains , in rocks that had been qu ##ar ##ried from deep below earth ##s surface . ) the fossils formed within the rocks as a result of mysterious forces . but for ste ##no , the close resemblance between fossils and modern organisms was impossible to ignore . instead of in ##voking supernatural forces , ste ##no concluded that fossils were once parts of living creatures .

S-69	the fossils formed within the rocks it wasn ##t always known that fossils were parts of living organisms . in 1666 , a young doctor named nicholas ste ##no di ##sse ##cted the head of an enormous great white shark that had been caught by fisherman near florence , italy . ste ##no was struck by the resemblance of the sharks teeth to fossils found in inland mountains and hills ( figure 1 . 1 ) . most people at the time did not believe that fossils were once part of living creatures . authors in that day thought that the fossils of marine animals found in tall mountains , miles from any ocean could be explained in one of two ways : the shells were washed up during the biblical flood . ( this explanation could not account for the fact that fossils were not only found on mountains , but also within mountains , in rocks that had been qu ##ar ##ried from deep below earth ##s surface . ) the fossils formed within the rocks as a result of mysterious forces . but for ste ##no , the close resemblance between fossils and modern organisms was impossible to ignore . instead of in ##voking supernatural forces , ste ##no concluded that fossils were once parts of living creatures . fossil shark tooth ( left ) and modern shark tooth ( right ) .

S-129	brain and spinal cord injuries most commonly occur the brain and spinal cord are protected within bones of the skeletal system , but injuries to these organs still occur . with mild injuries , there may be no lasting effects . with severe injuries , there may be permanent disability or even death . brain and spinal cord injuries most commonly occur because of car crashes or athletic activities . fortunately , many injuries can be prevented by wearing seat belts and safety helmets ( see figure 20 . 9 ) . avoiding unnecessary risks , such as doing stunts on a bike or diving into shallow water , can also reduce the chances of brain and spinal cord injuries . the most common type of brain injury is a concussion . this is a bruise on the surface of the brain . it may cause temporary symptoms such as headache and confusion . most concussion ##s heal on their own in a few days or weeks . however , repeated concussion ##s can lead to permanent changes in the brain . more serious brain injuries also often cause permanent brain damage . spinal cord injuries may cause paralysis . some people recover from spinal cord injuries . however , many people remain paralyzed for life . this happens when the spinal cord can no longer transmit nerve impulse ##s between the body and brain .

S-239	however in radio broadcasts , sounds are encoded in radio waves that are sent out through the atmosphere from a radio tower . a receiver detect ##s the radio waves and changes them back to sounds . you ##ve probably listened to both am and fm radio stations . how sounds are encoded in radio waves differs between am and fm broadcasts . am stands for amplitude modulation . in am broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the amplitude of radio waves . am broadcasts use longer ##wave ##len ##gt ##h radio waves than fm broadcasts . because of their longer wavelengths , am radio waves reflect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called the ion ##osphere . you can see how this happens in figure 21 . 8 . this allows am radio waves to reach radio receivers that are very far away from the radio tower . fm stands for frequency modulation . in fm broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency of radio waves . frequency modulation allows fm waves to en ##code more information than does amplitude modulation , so fm broadcasts usually sound clearer than am broadcasts . however , because of their shorter wavelength , fm waves do not reflect off the ion ##osphere . instead , they pass right through it and out into space ( see figure 21 . 8 ) . as a result , fm waves cannot reach very distant receivers .

S-275	magnet ##ism is magnet ##ism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet . magnet ##ism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter . when electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom , it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet , with north and south poles and a magnetic field . in most materials , the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions , so overall the material is not magnetic . examples of non ##ma ##gne ##tic materials include wood , glass , plastic , paper , copper , and aluminum . these materials are not attracted to magnet ##s and cannot become magnet ##s . in other materials , there are regions where the north and south poles of atoms are all lined up in the same direction . these regions are called magnetic domains . generally , the magnetic domains point in different directions , so the material is still not magnetic . however , the material can be magnet ##ized ( made into a magnet ) by placing it in a magnetic field . when this happens , all the magnetic domains line up , and the material becomes a magnet . you can see this in the figure 1 . 1 . materials that can be mag ##ni ##tized are called fe ##rro ##ma ##gne ##tic materials . they include iron , cobalt , and nickel .

S-136	human actions is too much of a good thing another major problem caused by air pollution is global climate change . gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels increase the greenhouse effect and raise earth ##s temperature . the greenhouse effect is a natural feature of earth ##s atmosphere . it occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere , including carbon dioxide , ra ##dia ##te the suns heat back down to earth ##s surface . figure 25 . 2 shows how this happens . without greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , the heat would escape into space . the natural greenhouse effect of earth ##s atmosphere keeps the planets temperature within a range that can support life . the rise in greenhouse gases due to human actions is too much of a good thing . it increases the greenhouse effect and causes earth ##s average temperature to rise . rising global temperatures , in turn , are melting polar ice caps and glaciers . figure 25 . 3 shows how much smaller the arctic ice cap was in 2012 than it was in 1984 . with more liquid water on earth ##s surface , sea levels are rising . adding more heat energy to earth ##s atmosphere also causes more extreme weather and changes in precipitation patterns . global warming is already causing food and water shortages and species extinction ##s . these problems will only grow worse unless steps are taken to curb greenhouse gases and global climate change .

S-274	the movement of electrons within atoms of matter magnet ##ism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet . magnet ##ism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter . when electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom , it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet , with north and south poles and a magnetic field . in most materials , the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions , so overall the material is not magnetic . examples of non ##ma ##gne ##tic materials include wood , glass , plastic , paper , copper , and aluminum . these materials are not attracted to magnet ##s and cannot become magnet ##s . in other materials , there are regions where the north and south poles of atoms are all lined up in the same direction . these regions are called magnetic domains . generally , the magnetic domains point in different directions , so the material is still not magnetic . however , the material can be magnet ##ized ( made into a magnet ) by placing it in a magnetic field . when this happens , all the magnetic domains line up , and the material becomes a magnet . you can see this in the figure 1 . 1 . materials that can be mag ##ni ##tized are called fe ##rro ##ma ##gne ##tic materials . they include iron , cobalt , and nickel .

S-238	their shorter wavelength , fm waves do not reflect off the ion ##osphere in radio broadcasts , sounds are encoded in radio waves that are sent out through the atmosphere from a radio tower . a receiver detect ##s the radio waves and changes them back to sounds . you ##ve probably listened to both am and fm radio stations . how sounds are encoded in radio waves differs between am and fm broadcasts . am stands for amplitude modulation . in am broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the amplitude of radio waves . am broadcasts use longer ##wave ##len ##gt ##h radio waves than fm broadcasts . because of their longer wavelengths , am radio waves reflect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called the ion ##osphere . you can see how this happens in figure 21 . 8 . this allows am radio waves to reach radio receivers that are very far away from the radio tower . fm stands for frequency modulation . in fm broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency of radio waves . frequency modulation allows fm waves to en ##code more information than does amplitude modulation , so fm broadcasts usually sound clearer than am broadcasts . however , because of their shorter wavelength , fm waves do not reflect off the ion ##osphere . instead , they pass right through it and out into space ( see figure 21 . 8 ) . as a result , fm waves cannot reach very distant receivers .

S-243	magnet ##ism is magnet ##ism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter . when electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom , it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet , with north and south poles and a magnetic field . in most materials , the electrons orbiting the nuclei of the atoms are arranged in such a way that the materials have no magnetic properties . also , in most types of matter , the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions , so overall the matter is not magnetic . examples of non ##ma ##gne ##tic materials include wood , glass , plastic , paper , copper , and aluminum . these materials are not attracted to magnet ##s and cannot become magnet ##s . in other materials , electrons fill the orbital ##s of the atoms that make up the material in a way to allow for each atom to have a tiny magnetic field , giving each atom a tiny north and south pole . there are large areas where the north and south poles of atoms are all lined up in the same direction . these areas are called magnetic domains . generally , the magnetic domains point in different directions , so the material is still not magnetic . however , the material can be magnet ##ized by placing it in a magnetic field . when this happens , all the magnetic domains become aligned , and the material becomes a magnet . this is illustrated in figure 24 . 6 . materials that can be magnet ##ized are called fe ##rro ##ma ##gne ##tic materials . they include iron , cobalt , and nickel .

S-48	para ##lla ##x distances to stars that are relatively close to us can be measured using para ##lla ##x . para ##lla ##x is an apparent shift in position that takes place when the position of the observer changes . to see an example of para ##lla ##x , try holding your finger about 1 foot ( 30 cm ) in front of your eyes . now , while focusing on your finger , close one eye and then the other . alternate back and forth between eyes , and pay attention to how your finger appears to move . the shift in position of your finger is an example of para ##lla ##x . now try moving your finger closer to your eyes , and repeat the experiment . do you notice any difference ? the closer your finger is to your eyes , the greater the position changes because of para ##lla ##x . as figure 1 . 1 shows , astronomers use this same principle to measure the distance to stars . instead of a finger , they focus on a star , and instead of switching back and forth between eyes , they switch between the biggest possible differences in observing position . to do this , an astronomer first looks at the star from one position and notes where the star is relative to more distant stars . now where will the astronomer go to make an observation the greatest possible distance from the first observation ? in six months , after earth moves from one side of its orbit around the sun to the other side , the astronomer looks at the star again . this time para ##lla ##x causes the star to appear in a different position relative to more distant stars . from the size of this shift , astronomers can calculate the distance to the star .

S-110	nitrogen oxide ##s any city can have photo ##chemical sm ##og , but it is most common in sunny , dry locations . a rise in the number of vehicles in cities worldwide has increased photo ##chemical sm ##og . nitrogen oxide ##s , ozone , and several other compounds are some of the components of this type of air pollution . photo ##chemical sm ##og forms when car exhaust is exposed to sunlight . nitrogen oxide is created by gas combustion in cars and then into the air ( figure 1 . 3 ) . in the presence of sunshine , the no ##2 splits and releases an oxygen ion ( o ) . the o then combines with an oxygen molecule ( o ##2 ) to form ozone ( o ##3 ) . this reaction can also go in reverse : ni ##tric oxide ( no ) removes an oxygen atom from ozone to make it o ##2 . the direction the reaction goes depends on how much no ##2 and no there is . if no ##2 is three times more abundant than no , ozone will be produced . if ni ##tric oxide levels are high , ozone will not be created . the brown color of the air behind the golden gate bridge is typical of california cities , because of nitrogen oxide ##s . ozone is one of the major secondary poll ##uta ##nts . it is created by a chemical reaction that takes place in exhaust and in the presence of sunlight . the gas is ac ##rid - smelling and whitish . warm , dry cities surrounded by mountains , such as los angeles , phoenix , and denver , are especially prone to photo ##chemical sm ##og . photo ##chemical sm ##og peaks at midday on the hottest days of summer . ozone is also a greenhouse gas .

S-49	the closer your finger is to your eyes , the greater the position changes distances to stars that are relatively close to us can be measured using para ##lla ##x . para ##lla ##x is an apparent shift in position that takes place when the position of the observer changes . to see an example of para ##lla ##x , try holding your finger about 1 foot ( 30 cm ) in front of your eyes . now , while focusing on your finger , close one eye and then the other . alternate back and forth between eyes , and pay attention to how your finger appears to move . the shift in position of your finger is an example of para ##lla ##x . now try moving your finger closer to your eyes , and repeat the experiment . do you notice any difference ? the closer your finger is to your eyes , the greater the position changes because of para ##lla ##x . as figure 1 . 1 shows , astronomers use this same principle to measure the distance to stars . instead of a finger , they focus on a star , and instead of switching back and forth between eyes , they switch between the biggest possible differences in observing position . to do this , an astronomer first looks at the star from one position and notes where the star is relative to more distant stars . now where will the astronomer go to make an observation the greatest possible distance from the first observation ? in six months , after earth moves from one side of its orbit around the sun to the other side , the astronomer looks at the star again . this time para ##lla ##x causes the star to appear in a different position relative to more distant stars . from the size of this shift , astronomers can calculate the distance to the star .

S-194	these sensory neurons found inside of your body when you look at the prick ##ly cactus pictured below ( figure 1 . 1 ) , does the word " ou ##ch " come to mind ? touching the cactus would be painful . touch is the sense of pain , pressure , or temperature . touch depends on sensory neurons , or nerve cells , in the skin . the skin on the palms of the hands , sole ##s of the feet , and face has the most sensory neurons and is especially sensitive to touch . the tongue and lips are very sensitive to touch as well . neurons that sense pain are also found inside the body in muscles , joints , and organs . if you have a stomach ache or pain from a sp ##rained ankle , its because of these sensory neurons found inside of your body . the following example shows how messages about touch travel from sensory neurons to the brain , as well as how the brain responds to the messages . suppose you wanted to test the temperature of the water in a lake before jumping in . you might stick one bare foot in the water . neurons in the skin on your foot would sense the temperature of the water and send a message about it to your central nervous system . the frontal lobe of the ce ##re ##br ##um would process the information . it might decide that the water is really cold and send a message to your muscles to pull your foot out of the water . in some cases , messages about pain or temperature don ##t travel all the way to and from the brain . instead , they travel only as far as the spinal cord , and the spinal cord responds to the messages by giving orders to the muscles . this allows you to respond to pain more quickly . when messages avoid the brain in this way , it forms a reflex arc , like the one shown below ( figure 1 . 2 ) .

S-272	their number of vale ##nce electrons electrons in the outer ##most energy level of an atom have a special significance . these electrons are called vale ##nce electrons , and they determine many of the properties of an atom . an atom is most stable if its outer ##most energy level contains as many electrons as it can hold . for example , helium has two electrons , both in the first energy level . this energy level can hold only two electrons , so helium ##s only energy level is full . this makes helium a very stable element . in other words , its atoms are unlikely to react with other atoms . consider the elements flu ##orin ##e and lithium , modeled in the figure 1 . 3 . flu ##orin ##e has seven of eight possible electrons in its outer ##most energy level , which is energy level ii . it would be more stable if it had one more electron because this would fill its outer ##most energy level . lithium , on the other hand , has just one of eight possible electrons in its outer ##most energy level ( also energy level ii ) . it would be more stable if it had one less electron because it would have a full outer energy level ( now energy level i ) . both flu ##orin ##e and lithium are highly reactive elements because of their number of vale ##nce electrons . flu ##orin ##e will readily gain one electron and lithium will just as readily give up one electron to become more stable . in fact , lithium and flu ##orin ##e will react together as shown in the figure 1 . 4 . when the two elements react , lithium transfers its one extra electron to flu ##orin ##e . q : a neon atom has ten electrons . how many electrons does it have in its outer ##most energy level ? how stable do you think a neon atom is ? a : a neon atom has two electrons in energy level i and its remaining eight electrons in energy level ii , which can

S-195	if you have a stomach ache or pain from a sp ##rained ankle , its when you look at the prick ##ly cactus pictured below ( figure 1 . 1 ) , does the word " ou ##ch " come to mind ? touching the cactus would be painful . touch is the sense of pain , pressure , or temperature . touch depends on sensory neurons , or nerve cells , in the skin . the skin on the palms of the hands , sole ##s of the feet , and face has the most sensory neurons and is especially sensitive to touch . the tongue and lips are very sensitive to touch as well . neurons that sense pain are also found inside the body in muscles , joints , and organs . if you have a stomach ache or pain from a sp ##rained ankle , its because of these sensory neurons found inside of your body . the following example shows how messages about touch travel from sensory neurons to the brain , as well as how the brain responds to the messages . suppose you wanted to test the temperature of the water in a lake before jumping in . you might stick one bare foot in the water . neurons in the skin on your foot would sense the temperature of the water and send a message about it to your central nervous system . the frontal lobe of the ce ##re ##br ##um would process the information . it might decide that the water is really cold and send a message to your muscles to pull your foot out of the water . in some cases , messages about pain or temperature don ##t travel all the way to and from the brain . instead , they travel only as far as the spinal cord , and the spinal cord responds to the messages by giving orders to the muscles . this allows you to respond to pain more quickly . when messages avoid the brain in this way , it forms a reflex arc , like the one shown below ( figure 1 . 2 ) .

S-174	lifting against gravity when skeletal muscles contract , bones move . but how do muscles make your bones move ? a voluntary muscles usually works across a joint . it is attached to both the bones on either side of the joint by strong cords called tend ##ons . a tend ##on is a tough band of connect ##ive tissue that connects a muscle to a bone . tend ##ons are similar to ligament ##s , except that ligament ##s join bones to each other . muscles move the body by contracting against the skeleton . when muscles contract , they get shorter . by contracting , muscles pull on bones and allow the body to move . muscles can only contract . they cannot actively extend , though they can move or relax back into the non - contracted neutral position . therefore , to move bones in opposite directions , pairs of muscles must work in opposition . each muscle in the pair works against the other to move bones at the joints of the body . the muscle that contracts to cause a joint to bend is called the flex ##or . the muscle that contracts to cause the joint to straighten is called the ex ##tens ##or . when one muscle is contracted , the other muscle from the pair is always elongated . for example , the biceps and tri ##ce ##ps muscles work together to allow you to bend and straighten your elbow . when you want to bend your elbow , your biceps muscle contracts ( figure 1 . 1 ) , and , at the same time , the tri ##ce ##ps muscle relax ##es . the biceps is the flex ##or , and the tri ##ce ##ps is the ex ##tens ##or of your elbow joint . other muscles that work together are the quad ##rice ##ps and ham ##st ##ring ##s used to bend and straighten the knee , and the pe ##ctor ##als and trap ##ez ##ius used to move the arms and shoulders forward and backward . during daily routines we do not use muscles equally . for example , we use our biceps more than our tri ##ce ##ps due to lifting against gravity .

S-175	for example , we use our biceps more than our tri ##ce ##ps when skeletal muscles contract , bones move . but how do muscles make your bones move ? a voluntary muscles usually works across a joint . it is attached to both the bones on either side of the joint by strong cords called tend ##ons . a tend ##on is a tough band of connect ##ive tissue that connects a muscle to a bone . tend ##ons are similar to ligament ##s , except that ligament ##s join bones to each other . muscles move the body by contracting against the skeleton . when muscles contract , they get shorter . by contracting , muscles pull on bones and allow the body to move . muscles can only contract . they cannot actively extend , though they can move or relax back into the non - contracted neutral position . therefore , to move bones in opposite directions , pairs of muscles must work in opposition . each muscle in the pair works against the other to move bones at the joints of the body . the muscle that contracts to cause a joint to bend is called the flex ##or . the muscle that contracts to cause the joint to straighten is called the ex ##tens ##or . when one muscle is contracted , the other muscle from the pair is always elongated . for example , the biceps and tri ##ce ##ps muscles work together to allow you to bend and straighten your elbow . when you want to bend your elbow , your biceps muscle contracts ( figure 1 . 1 ) , and , at the same time , the tri ##ce ##ps muscle relax ##es . the biceps is the flex ##or , and the tri ##ce ##ps is the ex ##tens ##or of your elbow joint . other muscles that work together are the quad ##rice ##ps and ham ##st ##ring ##s used to bend and straighten the knee , and the pe ##ctor ##als and trap ##ez ##ius used to move the arms and shoulders forward and backward . during daily routines we do not use muscles equally . for example , we use our biceps more than our tri ##ce ##ps due to lifting against gravity .

S-109	these differences are often tides are the daily rise and fall of sea level at any given place . the pull of the moons gravity on earth is the primary cause of tides and the pull of the suns gravity on earth is the secondary cause ( figure 1 . 1 ) . the moon has a greater effect because , although it is much smaller than the sun , it is much closer . the moons pull is about twice that of the suns . to understand the tides it is easiest to start with the effect of the moon on earth . as the moon revolves around our planet , its gravity pulls earth toward it . the lit ##hos ##pher ##e is unable to move much , but the water is pulled by the gravity and a bulge is created . this bulge is the high tide beneath the moon . on the other side of the earth , a high tide is produced where the moons pull is weak ##est . these two water bulge ##s on opposite sides of the earth aligned with the moon are the high tides . the places directly in between the high tides are low tides . as the earth rotate ##s beneath the moon , a single spot will experience two high tides and two low tides approximately every day . high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes . the reason is that the moon takes 24 hours and 50 minutes to rotate once around the earth , so the moon is over the same location every 24 hours and 50 minutes . since high tides occur twice a day , one arrives each 12 hours and 25 minutes . what is the time between a high tide and the next low tide ? the gravity of the sun also pulls earth ##s water towards it and causes its own tides . because the sun is so far away , its pull is smaller than the moons . some coastal areas do not follow this pattern at all . these coastal areas may have one high and one low tide per day or a different amount of time between two high tides . these differences are often because of local conditions , such as the shape of the coastline that the tide is entering . the gravitational attraction of the moon to ocean water creates the high and low tides .

S-108	local conditions , such as the shape of the coastline that the tide is entering tides are the daily rise and fall of sea level at any given place . the pull of the moons gravity on earth is the primary cause of tides and the pull of the suns gravity on earth is the secondary cause ( figure 1 . 1 ) . the moon has a greater effect because , although it is much smaller than the sun , it is much closer . the moons pull is about twice that of the suns . to understand the tides it is easiest to start with the effect of the moon on earth . as the moon revolves around our planet , its gravity pulls earth toward it . the lit ##hos ##pher ##e is unable to move much , but the water is pulled by the gravity and a bulge is created . this bulge is the high tide beneath the moon . on the other side of the earth , a high tide is produced where the moons pull is weak ##est . these two water bulge ##s on opposite sides of the earth aligned with the moon are the high tides . the places directly in between the high tides are low tides . as the earth rotate ##s beneath the moon , a single spot will experience two high tides and two low tides approximately every day . high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes . the reason is that the moon takes 24 hours and 50 minutes to rotate once around the earth , so the moon is over the same location every 24 hours and 50 minutes . since high tides occur twice a day , one arrives each 12 hours and 25 minutes . what is the time between a high tide and the next low tide ? the gravity of the sun also pulls earth ##s water towards it and causes its own tides . because the sun is so far away , its pull is smaller than the moons . some coastal areas do not follow this pattern at all . these coastal areas may have one high and one low tide per day or a different amount of time between two high tides . these differences are often because of local conditions , such as the shape of the coastline that the tide is entering . the gravitational attraction of the moon to ocean water creates the high and low tides .

S-168	chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions . when most people think of air pollution , they think of the pollution outdoors . but it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution . your home or school classroom probably doesn ##t get much fresh air . sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs . but this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors . and people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors . so exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk . indoor air poll ##uta ##nts include both chemical and biological poll ##uta ##nts . chemical poll ##uta ##nts include the following : ra ##don , a radioactive gas released from the earth in certain locations . it can become trapped inside buildings and increase your risk of cancer . formal ##deh ##yde , a toxic gas emitted from building materials , such as carpet ##ing and pl ##ywood . volatile organic compounds ( vo ##cs ) , which are given off by paint and solvent ##s as they dry . they can cause cause long - term health effects . second ##hand smoke , which comes from breathing the smoke release from tobacco products . second ##hand smoke is also the smoke exhaled by a cigarette smoke ##r . this smoke is extremely dangerous to human health . carbon mono ##xide ( co ) , a toxic gas released by burning fossil fuels . it is often released indoors by faulty chimneys , gas - powered generators , or burning charcoal ; it can be extremely dangerous . dry cleaning fluids , such as te ##tra ##ch ##lor ##oe ##thy ##lene , which can be released from clothing days after dry cleaning . the past use of asbestos in factories and in homes . asbestos is a very dangerous material , and it was used in many buildings ( figure 1 . 1 ) . asbestos can cause cancer and other lung diseases . the use of asbestos is not allowed today . the use of asbestos in industry and do - me ##stic environments in the past , as in the asbestos - covered pipes in the oil - refining plant pictured here , has left a potentially very dangerous material in many bus ##i - ness ##es . biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors . these are produced from : pet dan ##der . dust from tiny skin fl ##akes and deco ##mp ##osed hair . dust mit ##es . mold from walls , ceilings , and other structures . air conditioning systems that can inc ##uba ##te certain bacteria and mold . pollen , dust , and mold from house ##pl ##ants , soil , and surrounding gardens .

S-157	food moves through the es ##op ##ha ##gus the mouth is the first organ that food enters . but digest ##ion may start even before you put the first bite of food into your mouth . just seeing or smelling food can cause the release of saliva and digest ##ive enzymes in your mouth . this diagram shows how muscles push food through the digest ##ive system . muscle contraction ##s travel through the system in waves , pushing the food ahead of them . this is called per ##ista ##ls ##is . once you start eating , saliva wet ##s the food , which makes it easier to break up and swallow . digest ##ive enzymes , including the enzyme amy ##lase , start breaking down star ##ches into sugar ##s . your tongue helps mix the food with the saliva and enzymes . your teeth also help digest food . your front teeth are sharp . they cut and tear food when you bite into it . your back teeth are broad and flat . they grind food into smaller pieces when you chew . chewing is part of mechanical digest ##ion . your tongue pushes the food to the back of your mouth so you can swallow it . when you swallow , the lump of chewed food passes down your throat to your es ##op ##ha ##gus . the es ##op ##ha ##gus is a narrow tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach . food moves through the es ##op ##ha ##gus because of per ##ista ##ls ##is . at the lower end of the es ##op ##ha ##gus , a circular muscle controls the opening to the stomach . the muscle relax ##es to let food pass into the stomach . then the muscle contracts again to prevent food from passing back into the es ##op ##ha ##gus . some people think that gravity moves food through the es ##op ##ha ##gus . if that were true , food would move through the es ##op ##ha ##gus only when you are sitting or standing upright . in fact , because of per ##ista ##ls ##is , food can move through the es ##op ##ha ##gus no matter what position you are in ##eve ##n upside down ! just don ##t try to swallow food when you are upside down ##you could choke ! the stomach is a sac - like organ at the end of the es ##op ##ha ##gus . it has thick muscular walls . the muscles contract and relax . this moves the food around and helps break it into smaller pieces . mixing the food around with the enzyme pepsi ##n and other chemicals helps digest proteins . water , salt , and simple sugar ##s can be absorbed into the blood from the stomach . most other substances are broken down further in the small int ##est ##ine before they are absorbed . the stomach stores food until the small int ##est ##ine is ready to receive

S-188	genes on the x chromosome what determines if a baby is a male or female ? recall that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes ##and one of those pairs is the sex chromosomes . everyone has two sex chromosomes . your sex chromosomes can be x or y . females have two x chromosomes ( xx ) , while males have one x chromosome and one y chromosome ( x ##y ) . if a baby inherit ##s an x chromosome from the father and an x chromosome from the mother , what will be the child ##s sex ? the baby will have two x chromosomes , so it will be female . if the fathers sperm carries the y chromosome , the child will be male . notice that a mother can only pass on an x chromosome , so the sex of the baby is determined by the father . the father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the y or x chromosome , so there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be male , and there is a 50 percent chance a child will be female . this 50 : 50 chance occurs for each baby . a couples first five children could all be boys . the sixth child still has a 50 : 50 chance of being a girl . one special pattern of inheritance that doesn ##t fit men ##del ##s rules is sex - linked inheritance , referring to the in ##her - it ##ance of traits that are located on genes on the sex chromosomes . since males and females do not have the same sex chromosomes , there will be differences between the sexes in how these sex - linked traits ##tra ##its linked to genes located on the sex chromosomes ##are expressed . sex - linked traits usually refer to traits due to genes on the x chromosome . one example of a sex - linked trait is red - green color ##bl ##ind ##ness . people with this type of color ##bl ##ind ##ness cannot tell the difference between red and green . they often see these colors as shades of brown ( figure 1 . 1 ) . boys are much more likely to be color ##bl ##ind than girls ( table 1 . 1 ) . this is because color ##bl ##ind ##ness is a sex - linked , recess ##ive trait . boys only have one x chromosome , so if that chromosome carries the gene for color ##bl ##ind ##ness , they will be color ##bl ##ind . as girls have two x chromosomes , a girl can have one x chromosome with the color ##bl ##ind gene and one x chromosome with a normal gene for color vision . since color ##bl ##ind ##ness is recess ##ive , the dominant normal gene will mask the recess ##ive color ##bl ##ind gene . females with one color ##bl ##ind ##ness all ##ele and one normal all ##ele are referred

S-189	sex - linked traits usually refer to traits what determines if a baby is a male or female ? recall that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes ##and one of those pairs is the sex chromosomes . everyone has two sex chromosomes . your sex chromosomes can be x or y . females have two x chromosomes ( xx ) , while males have one x chromosome and one y chromosome ( x ##y ) . if a baby inherit ##s an x chromosome from the father and an x chromosome from the mother , what will be the child ##s sex ? the baby will have two x chromosomes , so it will be female . if the fathers sperm carries the y chromosome , the child will be male . notice that a mother can only pass on an x chromosome , so the sex of the baby is determined by the father . the father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the y or x chromosome , so there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be male , and there is a 50 percent chance a child will be female . this 50 : 50 chance occurs for each baby . a couples first five children could all be boys . the sixth child still has a 50 : 50 chance of being a girl . one special pattern of inheritance that doesn ##t fit men ##del ##s rules is sex - linked inheritance , referring to the in ##her - it ##ance of traits that are located on genes on the sex chromosomes . since males and females do not have the same sex chromosomes , there will be differences between the sexes in how these sex - linked traits ##tra ##its linked to genes located on the sex chromosomes ##are expressed . sex - linked traits usually refer to traits due to genes on the x chromosome . one example of a sex - linked trait is red - green color ##bl ##ind ##ness . people with this type of color ##bl ##ind ##ness cannot tell the difference between red and green . they often see these colors as shades of brown ( figure 1 . 1 ) . boys are much more likely to be color ##bl ##ind than girls ( table 1 . 1 ) . this is because color ##bl ##ind ##ness is a sex - linked , recess ##ive trait . boys only have one x chromosome , so if that chromosome carries the gene for color ##bl ##ind ##ness , they will be color ##bl ##ind . as girls have two x chromosomes , a girl can have one x chromosome with the color ##bl ##ind gene and one x chromosome with a normal gene for color vision . since color ##bl ##ind ##ness is recess ##ive , the dominant normal gene will mask the recess ##ive color ##bl ##ind gene . females with one color ##bl ##ind ##ness all ##ele and one normal all

S-106	his contributions directly to astronomy , and galileo gal ##ile ##i ( 156 ##4 - 1642 ) was a very important person in the development of modern astronomy , both because of his contributions directly to astronomy , and because of his work in physics . he provided the crucial observations that proved the cope ##rn ##ica ##n hypothesis , and also laid the foundations for a correct understanding of how objects moved on the surface of the earth and of gravity . one could , with considerable justification , view galileo as the father both of modern astronomy and of modern physics . galileo did not in ##vent the telescope , but he was the first to turn his telescope toward the sky to study the heavens systematically . his telescope was poorer than even a cheap modern amateur telescope , but what he observed in the heavens showed errors in aristotle ##s opinion of the universe and the world ##view that it supported . observations through galileo ##s telescope made it clear that the earth - centered and earth doesn ##t move solar system of aristotle was incorrect . since church officials had made some of aristotle ##s opinions a part of the religious views of the church , proving aristotle ##s views to be incorrect also pointed out flaws in the church . galileo observed four points of light that changed their positions around the planet jupiter and he concluded that these were moons in orbit around jupiter . these observations showed that there were new things in the heavens that aristotle and ptolemy had known nothing about . furthermore , they demonstrated that a planet could have moons circling it that would not be left behind as the planet moved around its orbit . one of the arguments against the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system had been that if the moon were in orbit around the earth and the earth in orbit around the sun , the earth would leave the moon behind as it moved around its orbit . galileo used his telescope to show that venus , like the moon , went through a complete set of phases . this observation was extremely important because it was the first observation that was consistent with the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system but not the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system . in the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic system , venus should always be in crescent phase as viewed from the earth because the sun is beyond venus , but in the cope ##rn ##ica ##n system venus should exhibit a complete set of phases over time as viewed from the earth because it is illuminated from the center of its orbit . it is important to note that this was the first empirical evidence ( coming almost a century after cope ##rn ##icus ) that allowed a definitive test of the two models . until that point , both the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic and cope ##rn ##ica ##n models described the available data . the

S-226	the need to drill through underground rocks renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limit ##less in supply . renewable energy resources include sunlight , moving water , wind , biomass , and geo ##thermal energy . each of these energy resources is described in table 17 . 1 . resources such as sunlight and wind are limit ##less in supply , so they will never run out . besides their availability , renewable energy resources also have the advantage of producing little if any pollution and not contributing to global warming . the technology needed to gather energy from renewable resources is currently expensive to install , but most of the resources themselves are free for the taking . here ? renewable energy resource sunlight the energy in sunlight , or solar energy , can be used to heat homes . it can also be used to produce electricity in solar cells . however , solar energy may not be practical in areas that are often cloudy . example solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a family ##s needs . moving water when water falls downhill , its potential energy is con - ve ##rted to kinetic energy that can turn a turbine and generate electricity . the water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam . a draw ##back of dams is that they flood land upstream and reduce water flow downstream . either effect may harm ecosystems . wind wind is moving air , so it has kinetic energy that can do work . remember the wind turbines that opened this chapter ? wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy . only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind to produce much electricity . many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and una ##tt ##ractive in the landscape . water flowing through hoover dam between arizona and nevada generates electricity for both of these states and also by southern california . the dam spans the colorado river . this old - fashioned windmill captures wind energy that is used for pumping water out of a well . windmill ##s like this one have been used for centuries . renewable energy resource biomass the stored chemical energy of trees and other plants is called biomass energy . when plant materials are burned , they produce thermal energy that can be used for heating , cooking , or generating electricity . biomass ##es ##pe ##cial ##ly wood ##is an important energy source in countries where most people can ##t afford fossil fuels . some plants can also be used to make ethanol , a fuel that is added to gasoline . ethanol produces less pollution than gasoline , but large areas of land are needed to grow the plants needed to make it . geo ##thermal heat below earth ##s surface ##cal ##led geo ##thermal en -

S-156	per ##ista ##ls ##is the mouth is the first organ that food enters . but digest ##ion may start even before you put the first bite of food into your mouth . just seeing or smelling food can cause the release of saliva and digest ##ive enzymes in your mouth . this diagram shows how muscles push food through the digest ##ive system . muscle contraction ##s travel through the system in waves , pushing the food ahead of them . this is called per ##ista ##ls ##is . once you start eating , saliva wet ##s the food , which makes it easier to break up and swallow . digest ##ive enzymes , including the enzyme amy ##lase , start breaking down star ##ches into sugar ##s . your tongue helps mix the food with the saliva and enzymes . your teeth also help digest food . your front teeth are sharp . they cut and tear food when you bite into it . your back teeth are broad and flat . they grind food into smaller pieces when you chew . chewing is part of mechanical digest ##ion . your tongue pushes the food to the back of your mouth so you can swallow it . when you swallow , the lump of chewed food passes down your throat to your es ##op ##ha ##gus . the es ##op ##ha ##gus is a narrow tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach . food moves through the es ##op ##ha ##gus because of per ##ista ##ls ##is . at the lower end of the es ##op ##ha ##gus , a circular muscle controls the opening to the stomach . the muscle relax ##es to let food pass into the stomach . then the muscle contracts again to prevent food from passing back into the es ##op ##ha ##gus . some people think that gravity moves food through the es ##op ##ha ##gus . if that were true , food would move through the es ##op ##ha ##gus only when you are sitting or standing upright . in fact , because of per ##ista ##ls ##is , food can move through the es ##op ##ha ##gus no matter what position you are in ##eve ##n upside down ! just don ##t try to swallow food when you are upside down ##you could choke ! the stomach is a sac - like organ at the end of the es ##op ##ha ##gus . it has thick muscular walls . the muscles contract and relax . this moves the food around and helps break it into smaller pieces . mixing the food around with the enzyme pepsi ##n and other chemicals helps digest proteins . water , salt , and simple sugar ##s can be absorbed into the blood from the stomach . most other substances are broken down further in the small int ##est ##ine before they are absorbed . the stomach stores food until the small int ##est ##ine is ready to receive it . a circular
