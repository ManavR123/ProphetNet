S-61	when the nebula collapsed , the gravity in the centre increased and the cloud began to turn . the most widely accepted explanation of the formation of the solar system is called the ne ##bu ##lous hypothesis . according to this hypothesis , the sun and the planets of our solar system formed about 4 . 6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust , called a nebula . the nebula was collected by gravity , which released potential gravitational energy . as small particles of dust and gas broke together to create larger particles , they produced kinetic energy . when the nebula collapsed , the gravity in the centre increased and the cloud began to turn because of its angular momentum . as he collapsed further , the rotation became faster , just like an ice skater turns faster when he pulls his arms on his sides during a rotation . much of the cloud mass migrated to its centre , but the rest of the material flattened into a huge disk . the disc contained hydrogen and helium , as well as heavier elements and even simple organic molecules .

S-203	according to einstein , objects bend towards each other newton ##s idea of gravity can predict the movement of most objects , but not all . in the early 1900s , albert einstein invented a theory of gravity that is better to predict how all objects move . einstein mathematical ##ly showed that gravity is not really a force in the sense that newton thought . instead , gravity is the result of deformation , or curvature , of space and time . imagine a bowling ball pressing on a tram ##pol ##ine . the tram ##pol ##ine surface would run down instead of flat . einstein theo ##rized that earth and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a similar way . this idea is shown in figure 13 . 19 . according to einstein , objects bend towards each other because of curves in space and time , not because they shoot each other with an attraction force like newton ' s thinking . you can see an animation of einstein ' s gravity theory at this ur ##l : http : / / einstein . the gravity theory , go to this ur ##l :

S-274	the motion of electrons inside matter atoms magnet ##ism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and act as a magnet . the magnet ##ism is due to the motion of electrons within the atoms of matter . when the electrons rotate around the nucleus of an atom , it makes the atom a tiny magnet , with north and south poles and a magnetic field . in most materials , the north and south poles of atoms point in all directions , so overall the material is not magnetic . wood , glass , plastic , paper , copper and aluminum are examples of non - magnetic materials . these materials are not attracted to magnet ##s and cannot become magnet ##s . in other materials , there are regions where the northern and southern poles of atoms are all aligned in the same direction . these regions are called magnetic domains . in general , magnetic domains point in different directions , so that the material is still not magnetic . however , the material can be magnet ##ized ( made by magnet ) by placing it in a magnetic field . when this happens , all magnetic domains align , and the material becomes a magnet . you can see it in figure 1 . 1 . materials that can be mag ##nified are called fe ##rro ##ma ##gne ##tic materials . they include iron , cobalt and nickel .

S-55	the planet over ##flow ##s around the equator the earth is a sphere or , more correctly , an ob ##late sp ##her ##oid , which is a sphere that is a little crushed at the poles and a little swollen at the equator . to be more technical , the minor axis ( diameter through the poles ) is smaller than the main axis ( diameter through the equator ) . half the sphere is a hemisphere . to the north of the equator is the northern hemisphere and to the south of the equator is the southern hemisphere . the eastern and western hemisphere ##s are also designated . what is the proof that the earth is spherical ? what evidence existed before spacecraft and satellites ? try to design an experiment involving a ship and the ocean to show that the earth is round . if you stand on the shore and a ship goes to sea , the ship becomes smaller as it moves away from you . the bottom of the ships also begins to disappear as the ship turns around the arc of the planet ( figure 1 . 1 ) . there are many other ways than the first scientists and sailors knew that the earth was not flat . the sun and the other planets of the solar system are also spherical . the larger satellites , those that have enough mass for their gravitational attraction to have made them round , are also spherical . the real form of the earth ##s is not spherical , but an ob ##late sp ##her ##oid . the planet over ##flow ##s around the equator due to mass collection in the middle due to rotational momentum .

S-174	gravity relief when the skeletal muscles contract , the bones move . but how do muscles move your bones ? a voluntary muscle usually works through a joint . it is attached to both bones on either side of the joint by strong cords called tend ##ons . a tend ##on is a hard band of connect ##ive tissue that connects a muscle to a bone . the ligament ##s are similar to the ligament ##s , except that the ligament ##s unite with each other . the muscles move the body by contracting against the skeleton . when the muscles contract , they become shorter . by contracting , the muscles pull on the bones and allow the body to move . the muscles can only contract . they cannot expand actively , although they can move or relax in the non - contractual neutral position . therefore , to move the bones in opposite directions , the muscle pairs must work in opposition . each muscle in the pair acts against the other to move the bones to the joints of the body . the muscle that contracts to cause a bend joint is called the flex ##or . the muscle that contracts to straighten the joint is called the ex ##tens ##or . when one muscle is contracted , the other muscle of the pair is always elongated . for example , biceps and tri ##ce ##ps work together to allow you to fold and straighten your elbow . when you want to bend your elbow , your muscle biceps contracts ( figure 1 . 1 ) and , at the same time , the tri ##ce ##ps muscle relax ##es . biceps are the flex ##or , and tri ##ce ##ps are the ex ##tens ##or of the elbow joint . other muscles that work together are quad ##rice ##ps and ham ##st ##ring ##s used to fold and straighten the knee , and pe ##ctor ##als and trap ##ez ##e used to move arms and shoulders forwards and backwards . during daily routines , we do not use the muscles equally . for example , we use our biceps more than our tri ##ce ##ps because of the rise against gravity .

S-205	the larger object is more difficult to move when gravity pulls objects to the ground , it speeds them up . the acceleration due to gravity is 9 . 8 m / s ##2 . in other words , the speed at which an object falls to earth increases each second by 9 . 8 m / s . therefore , after 1 second , an object falls at a speed of 9 . 8 m / s . after 2 seconds , it falls at a speed of 19 . 6 m / s ( 9 . 8 m / s 2 ) , and so on . this is shown in figure 13 . 20 . you can compare the acceleration due to gravity on earth , the moon and mars with the interactive animation called " free ##fall " to this ur ##l : http : / / jersey . u ##ore ##gon . ed ##u / v ##lab / . you might think that an object with a larger mass would accelerate faster than an object with less mass . after all , its largest mass means that it is driven by a stronger force of gravity . however , a more massive object accelerate ##s at the same rate as a less massive object . the reason ? the larger object is more difficult to move because of its larger mass . as a result , it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the less massive object . consider a bowling ball and a basketball . the bowling ball has a bigger mass than basketball . however , if you let the two bullets fall at the same time from the same distance above the ground , they would arrive on the ground together . this is true of all falling objects , unless air resistance affects one object more than another . for example , a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling g ##lan ##s due to the larger leaf surface . however , if the leaf and the ac ##orn fell in the absence of air ( i . e . in a vacuum ) , they would arrive on the ground at the same time .

S-74	bio ##ac ##cum ##ulation of mercury in these species do you know why you ' re supposed to eat big predatory fish like tuna rarely ? this is because of the bio ##ac ##cum ##ulation of mercury in these species . some poll ##uta ##nts remain in an organism throughout its life , a phenomenon called bio ##ac ##cum ##ulation . in this process , an organism accumulate ##s all the amount of a toxic compound that it consume ##s in its lifetime . not all substances bio ##ac ##cum ##ulate . can you name one that doesn ' t ? as ##pi ##rin does not bio ##ac ##cum ##ulate ; if so , a person would quickly accumulate a toxic amount in his or her body . compounds that bio ##ac ##cum ##ulate are usually stored in body fat ##s . in sediments , bacteria convert droplets to methyl ##mer ##cu ##ry . bacteria and plank ##ton store all mercury from all the sea ##water they ing ##est ( figure 1 . 2 ) . a small fish that eats bacteria and plank ##ton accumulate ##s all the mercury of all the small creatures he eats in his lifetime . a large fish accumulate ##s all the mercury of all the small fish that it eats in its lifetime . for a tuna at the top of the food chain , it ' s a lot of mercury . historical increases in mercury in the atmosphere : blue is volcanic eruptions ; brown , purple and pink are human causes . the red region shows the effect of industrial ##ization on atmospheric mercury . tuna therefore poses a danger to the health of everything that eats them because their bodies are so rich in mercury . that ' s why the government is recommend ##ing limits on how much tuna people eat . limiting the consumption of large predatory fish is particularly important for children and pregnant women . if mercury has just remained in a fat person , it would not be harmful , but that fat is used when a woman is pregnant or breast ##fe ##eding a baby . a person will also get mercury in their system when they ( or they ) burn fat while losing weight .

S-175	for example , we use our biceps more than our tri ##ce ##ps when the skeletal muscles contract , the bones move . but how do muscles move your bones ? a voluntary muscle usually works through a joint . it is attached to both bones on either side of the joint by strong cords called tend ##ons . a tend ##on is a hard band of connect ##ive tissue that connects a muscle to a bone . the ligament ##s are similar to the ligament ##s , except that the ligament ##s unite with each other . the muscles move the body by contracting against the skeleton . when the muscles contract , they become shorter . by contracting , the muscles pull on the bones and allow the body to move . the muscles can only contract . they cannot expand actively , although they can move or relax in the non - contractual neutral position . therefore , to move the bones in opposite directions , the muscle pairs must work in opposition . each muscle in the pair acts against the other to move the bones to the joints of the body . the muscle that contracts to cause a bend joint is called the flex ##or . the muscle that contracts to straighten the joint is called the ex ##tens ##or . when one muscle is contracted , the other muscle of the pair is always elongated . for example , biceps and tri ##ce ##ps work together to allow you to fold and straighten your elbow . when you want to bend your elbow , your muscle biceps contracts ( figure 1 . 1 ) and , at the same time , the tri ##ce ##ps muscle relax ##es . biceps are the flex ##or , and tri ##ce ##ps are the ex ##tens ##or of the elbow joint . other muscles that work together are quad ##rice ##ps and ham ##st ##ring ##s used to fold and straighten the knee , and pe ##ctor ##als and trap ##ez ##e used to move arms and shoulders forwards and backwards . during daily routines , we do not use the muscles equally . for example , we use our biceps more than our tri ##ce ##ps because of the rise against gravity .

S-103	these stars are less bright than expected the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram ( often called the h - r diagram ) is a sc ##atter graph that shows different star classes in the context of properties such as their brightness , absolute magnitude , color , and effective temperature . created around 1910 by e ##jn ##ar her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g and henry norris russell , the diagram provides a great help in understanding stellar evolution . there are several shapes of the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram , and the nomenclature is not very well defined . the original diagram showed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the absolute magnitude on the vertical axis . the shape below shows kelvin ' s temperature along the horizontal axis ranging from high temperature on the left to low temperature on the right and brightness on the vertical axis . one can think of the brightness as the brightness in the multiple ##s of the sun . a lu ##min ##osity of 100 on the axis would mean 100 times as bright as the sun . most stars occupy a region in the diagram along a line called the main sequence . during this stage , the stars merge hydrogen into helium in their hearts . the position of the sun in the main sequence is shown in the diagram . you should note that the axial scales in this diagram are not linear . the vertical scale is log ##ari ##th ##mic , each line is 100 times larger than the previous line . on the horizontal axis , as we move to the right , the temperature decreases from 1 , 000 to 1 , 000 degrees k between each line . if all other factors were the same , the highest stars would also be the brightest ( the brightest ) . in the main sequence of stars , we see that as the temperature rises to the left , the brightness also increases , demonstrating that the warm ##est stars in this group are also the brightest . however , there are stars that are less bright than their temperature predict ##s . this group of stars is called white dwarfs . these stars are less bright than expected because of their very small size . these dwarf stars are only one thousand ##th of the size of the stars in the main sequence . there are also stars that are much brighter than their temperature predict ##s . this group of stars are called red giants . they are brighter than their temperature predict ##s because they are much larger than the stars in the main sequence . these stars have increased the size of the stars in the main sequence to several thousand times . stars that are reddish in colour are cooler than other stars while stars that are blu ##ish in color are warmer than other stars . a white dwarf is
