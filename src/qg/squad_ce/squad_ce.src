do not change the speed of the object - l ##rb - magnitude of the velocity - rr ##b - , but only the direction of the velocity vector . [SEP] this means that the un ##balance ##d cent ##rip ##eta ##l force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path . such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object , and therefore do not change the speed of the object ( magnitude of the velocity ) , but only the direction of the velocity vector . the un ##balance ##d force that accelerate ##s an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path , and one that is tangent ##ial to the path .
means that for a closed system , the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system . the force [SEP] this means that for a closed system , the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system . the force , therefore , is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space , and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the con ##tour map of the elevation of an area .

macro ##physical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macro ##scopic statistical average of micro ##sta ##tes . [SEP] for certain physical scenarios , it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potential ##s . this is often due to macro ##physical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macro ##scopic statistical average of micro ##sta ##tes . for example , friction is caused by the gradient ##s of numerous electro ##static potential ##s between the atoms , but manifest ##s as a force model that is independent of any macro ##sca ##le position vector .
