coastal areas have a mild ##er climate than inland areas . they are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer . that ##s because land near an ocean is influenced by the temperature of the oceans . the temperature of ocean water is moderate and stable . why ? there are two major reasons : 1 . water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land . as a result , oceans never get as hot or as cold as land . 2 . water flows through all the worlds oceans . warm water from the equator mixes with cold water from the poles . the mixing of warm and cold water makes the water temperature moderate . even inland temperatures are mild ##er because of oceans . without oceans , there would be much bigger temperature swings all over earth . temperatures might plunge hundreds of degrees below freezing in the winter . in the summer , lakes and seas might boil ! life as we know it could not exist on earth without the oceans .

the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram ( often referred to as the h - r diagram ) is a sc ##atter graph that shows various classes of stars in the context of properties such as their lu ##min ##osity , absolute magnitude , color , and effective temperature . created around 1910 by e ##jn ##ar her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g and henry norris russell , the diagram provided a great help in understanding stellar evolution . there are several forms of the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram , and the nomenclature is not very well defined . the original diagram displayed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the absolute magnitude on the vertical axis . the form below shows kelvin temperature along the horizontal axis going from high temperature on the left to low temperature on the right and lu ##min ##osity on the vertical axis . we can think of the lu ##min ##osity as brightness in multiple ##s of the sun . a lu ##min ##osity of 100 on the axis would mean 100 times as bright as the sun . most of the stars occupy a region in the diagram along a line called the main sequence . during that stage , stars are fu ##sing hydrogen into helium in their cores . the position of the sun in the main sequence is shown in the diagram . you should note that the axial scales for this diagram are not linear . the vertical scale is log ##ari ##th ##mic , each line is 100 times greater than the previous line . on the horizontal axis , as we move to the right , the temperature reduces by between 1 , 000 and 10 , 000 degrees k between each line . if all other factors were the same , the highest temperature stars would also be the most luminous ( the brightest ) . in the main sequence of stars , we see that as the temperature increases to the left , the lu ##min ##osity also increases , demonstrating that the hottest stars in this grouping are also the brightest . there are stars , however , that are less bright than their temperature would predict . this group of stars is called white dwarfs . these stars are less bright than expected because of their very small size . these dwarf stars are only one one - thousand ##th the size of stars in the main sequence . there are also stars that are much brighter than their temperature would predict . this group of stars are called red giants . they are brighter than their temperature would predict because they are much larger than stars in the main sequence . these stars have expanded to several thousand times the size of stars in the main sequence . stars that are reddish in color are cooler than other stars while stars that are blu ##ish in color are hotter than other stars . a white dwarf is a stellar remnant that is very dense . a white dwarfs mass is comparable to the sun and its volume is comparable to that of earth . the very low brightness of a white dwarf comes from the emission of stored heat energy . white dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of any star whose mass is not great enough to become a neutron star . approximately 97 % of the stars in our galaxy will become neutron stars . after the hydrogen - fu ##sing lifetime of a main - sequence star of low or medium mass ends , it will expand to a red giant which fuse ##s helium to carbon and oxygen in its core . if a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon , around 1 billion k , an in ##ert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center . after blowing off its outer layers to form a planetary nebula , the core will be left behind to form the remnant white dwarf . white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen . a white dwarf is very hot when it is formed , but since it has no source of energy ( no further fusion reactions ) , it will gradually ra ##dia ##te away its energy and cool down . over a very long time , a white dwarf will cool to temperatures at which it will no longer emi ##t significant light , and it will become a cold black dwarf . a red giant star is a star with a mass like the sun that is in the last phase of its life , when hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel . with the gravitational collapse of the core , the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core . the outer layer of the star expands enormous ##ly up to 1000 times the size of the sun . when the sun becomes a red giant , its volume will include the orbit of mercury and venus and maybe even earth . the increased size increases the lu ##min ##osity even though the outer layer cool ##s to only 3000 k or so . the cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star . after a few more million years , the star evolve ##s into a white dwarf - planetary nebula system .

when gravity pulls objects toward the ground , it causes them to accelerate . acceleration due to gravity equals 9 . 8 m / s ##2 . in other words , the velocity at which an object falls toward earth increases each second by 9 . 8 m / s . therefore , after 1 second , an object is falling at a velocity of 9 . 8 m / s . after 2 seconds , it is falling at a velocity of 19 . 6 m / s ( 9 . 8 m / s 2 ) , and so on . this is illustrated in figure 13 . 20 . you can compare the acceleration due to gravity on earth , the moon , and mars with the interactive animation called " free ##fall " at this ur ##l : http : / / jersey . u ##ore ##gon . ed ##u / v ##lab / . you might think that an object with greater mass would accelerate faster than an object with less mass . after all , its greater mass means that it is pulled by a stronger force of gravity . however , a more massive object accelerate ##s at the same rate as a less massive object . the reason ? the more massive object is harder to move because of its greater mass . as a result , it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the less massive object . consider a bowling ball and a basketball . the bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball . however , if you were to drop both balls at the same time from the same distance above the ground , they would reach the ground together . this is true of all falling objects , unless air resistance affects one object more than another . for example , a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling ac ##orn because of the leafs greater surface area . however , if the leaf and ac ##orn were to fall in the absence of air ( that is , in a vacuum ) , they would reach the ground at the same time .

( there are also neutron ##s in the nucleus , but they have no electric charge . ) negative electrons stay in the area surrounding the positive nucleus because of the electromagnetic force of attraction between them . q : why do you think proton ##s cluster together in the nucleus of the atom instead of rep ##elling each other because of their like charges ? a : the electromagnetic force of rep ##ulsion between positively charged proton ##s is overcome by a stronger force , called the strong nuclear force .

just as earth orbits the sun , the moon also orbits earth . the moon is affected by earth ##s gravity more than it is by the gravity of the sun because the moon is much closer to earth . the gravity between earth and the moon pulls the moon toward earth . at the same time , the moon has forward velocity that partly counters the force of earth ##s gravity . so the moon orbits earth instead of falling down to the surface of the planet . the figure 1 . 2 shows the forces involved in the moons orbital motion around earth . in the diagram , v represents the forward velocity of the moon , and a represents the acceleration due to gravity between earth and the moon . the line en ##ci ##rc ##ling earth shows the moons actual orbit , which results from the combination of v and a .
