the difference in sign of their charges [SEP] the ions come together to create a molecule so that the electrical charges are balanced ; the positive charges balance the negative charges and the molecule has no electric charge . to balance the electrical charge , an atom can share its electron with another atom , give it or receive an electron from another atom . the assembly of ions to make molecules is called chemical bond . there are three main types of chemical bonds that are important in our discussion of minerals and rocks : ion bonding : electrons are transferred between atoms . one ion will give one or more electrons to another ion . table salt , sodium chloride ( na ##cl ) , is a common example of an ionic compound . note that sodium is on the left side of the periodic table and ch ##lor ##ine is on the right side of the periodic table . in figure 1 . 2 , a lithium atom donate ##s an electron to a flu ##orin ##e atom to form an ionic compound . the electron transfer gives the lithium ion a net charge of + 1 , and the flu ##orin ##e ion a net charge of - 1 . these ions bind because they experience an attractive force because of the difference in the sign of their charges . a co ##valent bond : in a co ##valent bond , an atom shares one or more electrons with another atom . periodic table of elements . lithium ( left ) and flu ##orin ##e ( right ) form an ionic compound called lithium flu ##ori ##de . in the methane ( ch ##4 ) image below ( figure 1 . 3 ) , the carbon ion ( with a net charge of + 4 ) shares a single electron of each of the four hydrogen ##s . co ##valent binding is widespread in organic compounds . in fact , your body is held together by the electrons shared by carbon ##s and hydrogen ##s ! co ##valent bonds are also very strong , which means that it takes a lot of energy to separate them . hydrogen bond : these weak inter ##mo ##le ##cular bonds form when the positive side of a polar molecule is attracted to the negative side of another polar molecule . water is a classic example of a polar molecule because it has a slightly positive side , and a slightly negative side . in fact , this property is the reason why water is so good at di ##sso ##lving things . the positive side of the molecule is attracted to methane when four hydrogen ##s and one carbon bind co ##valent ##ly . the negative ions and the negative side are attracted by the positive ions .

their greatest mass [SEP] when gravity pulls objects to the ground , it speeds them up . the acceleration due to gravity is 9 . 8 m / s ##2 . in other words , the speed at which an object falls to earth increases each second by 9 . 8 m / s . therefore , after 1 second , an object falls at a speed of 9 . 8 m / s . after 2 seconds , it falls at a speed of 19 . 6 m / s ( 9 . 8 m / s 2 ) , and so on . this is shown in figure 13 . 20 . you can compare the acceleration due to gravity on earth , the moon and mars with the interactive animation called " free ##fall " to this ur ##l : http : / / jersey . u ##ore ##gon . ed ##u / v ##lab / . you might think that an object with a larger mass would accelerate faster than an object with less mass . after all , its largest mass means that it is driven by a stronger force of gravity . however , a more massive object accelerate ##s at the same rate as a less massive object . the reason ? the larger object is more difficult to move because of its larger mass . as a result , it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the less massive object . consider a bowling ball and a basketball . the bowling ball has a bigger mass than basketball . however , if you let the two bullets fall at the same time from the same distance above the ground , they would arrive on the ground together . this is true of all falling objects , unless air resistance affects one object more than another . for example , a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling g ##lan ##s due to the larger leaf surface . however , if the leaf and the ac ##orn fell in the absence of air ( i . e . in a vacuum ) , they would arrive on the ground at the same time .

the electric field of a nearby loaded object [SEP] suppose you walked on a wool carpet in rubber - sold shoes and become negatively loaded . if you can then touch a metal door handle , the neutral metal electrons will be pushed back and move away from your hand before even touching the button . in this way , one end of the handle becomes positively loaded and the other end becomes negatively charged . that ' s what we call polar ##ization . polar ##ization occurs whenever electrons within a neutral object move because of the electric field of a nearby loaded object . it occurs without direct contact between the two objects . figure 1 . 2 shows how polar ##ization occurs . q : what happens when the plastic rod negatively loaded in the diagram is placed near the neutral metal plate ? a : the electrons in the plate are pushed back by positive loads in the stem . the electrons move away from the stem , causing a positive charge on one side of the plate and a negative charge on the other side .
