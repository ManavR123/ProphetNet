S-60	its angular momentum the most widely accepted explanation of how the solar system formed is called the nebula ##r hypothesis . according to this hypothesis , the sun and the planets of our solar system formed about 4 . 6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust , called a nebula . the nebula was drawn together by gravity , which released gravitational potential energy . as small particles of dust and gas smashed together to create larger ones , they released kinetic energy . as the nebula collapsed , the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin because of its angular momentum . as it collapsed further , the spinning got faster , much as an ice skater spins faster when he pulls his arms to his sides during a spin . much of the clouds mass migrated to its center but the rest of the material flattened out in an enormous disk . the disk contained hydrogen and helium , along with heavier elements and even simple organic molecules .

S-6	oceans coastal areas have a mild ##er climate than inland areas . they are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer . that ##s because land near an ocean is influenced by the temperature of the oceans . the temperature of ocean water is moderate and stable . why ? there are two major reasons : 1 . water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land . as a result , oceans never get as hot or as cold as land . 2 . water flows through all the worlds oceans . warm water from the equator mixes with cold water from the poles . the mixing of warm and cold water makes the water temperature moderate . even inland temperatures are mild ##er because of oceans . without oceans , there would be much bigger temperature swings all over earth . temperatures might plunge hundreds of degrees below freezing in the winter . in the summer , lakes and seas might boil ! life as we know it could not exist on earth without the oceans .

S-7	even inland temperatures are mild ##er coastal areas have a mild ##er climate than inland areas . they are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer . that ##s because land near an ocean is influenced by the temperature of the oceans . the temperature of ocean water is moderate and stable . why ? there are two major reasons : 1 . water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land . as a result , oceans never get as hot or as cold as land . 2 . water flows through all the worlds oceans . warm water from the equator mixes with cold water from the poles . the mixing of warm and cold water makes the water temperature moderate . even inland temperatures are mild ##er because of oceans . without oceans , there would be much bigger temperature swings all over earth . temperatures might plunge hundreds of degrees below freezing in the winter . in the summer , lakes and seas might boil ! life as we know it could not exist on earth without the oceans .

S-61	as the nebula collapsed , the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin the most widely accepted explanation of how the solar system formed is called the nebula ##r hypothesis . according to this hypothesis , the sun and the planets of our solar system formed about 4 . 6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust , called a nebula . the nebula was drawn together by gravity , which released gravitational potential energy . as small particles of dust and gas smashed together to create larger ones , they released kinetic energy . as the nebula collapsed , the gravity at the center increased and the cloud started to spin because of its angular momentum . as it collapsed further , the spinning got faster , much as an ice skater spins faster when he pulls his arms to his sides during a spin . much of the clouds mass migrated to its center but the rest of the material flattened out in an enormous disk . the disk contained hydrogen and helium , along with heavier elements and even simple organic molecules .

S-26	its blue - green color ur ##anus is a lot like jupiter and saturn . the planet is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium . there is a thick layer of gas on the outside . further on the inside is liquid . but ur ##anus has a higher percentage of icy materials than jupiter and saturn . these materials include water , ammonia , and methane . ur ##anus is also different because of its blue - green color . clouds of methane filter out red light . this leaves a blue - green color . the atmosphere of ur ##anus has bands of clouds . these clouds are hard to see in normal light . the result is that the planet looks like a plain blue ball . ur ##anus is the least massive outer planet . its mass is only about 14 times the mass of earth . like all of the outer planets , ur ##anus is much less dense than earth . gravity is actually weaker than on earth ##s surface . if you were at the top of the clouds on ur ##anus , you would weigh about 10 percent less than what you weigh on earth .

S-203	according to einstein , objects curve toward one another newton ##s idea of gravity can predict the motion of most but not all objects . in the early 1900s , albert einstein came up with a theory of gravity that is better at predicting how all objects move . einstein showed mathematical ##ly that gravity is not really a force in the sense that newton thought . instead , gravity is a result of the warp ##ing , or curving , of space and time . imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a tram ##pol ##ine . the surface of the tram ##pol ##ine would curve downward instead of being flat . einstein theo ##rized that earth and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a similar way . this idea is represented in figure 13 . 19 . according to einstein , objects curve toward one another because of the curves in space and time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction as newton thought . you can see an animation of einstein ##s theory of gravity at this ur ##l : http : / / einstein . theory of gravity , go to this ur ##l :

S-214	the wedge shape of the blade imagine trying to slice a tomato with a fork or spoon instead of a knife , like the one in figure 16 . 15 . the knife makes the job a lot easier because of the wedge shape of the blade . a wedge is a simple machine that consists of two inclined planes . but unlike one inclined plane , a wedge works only when it moves . it has a thin end and thick end , and the thin end is forced into an object to cut or split it . the chi ##sel in figure 16 . 15 is another example of a wedge . the input force is applied to the thick end of a wedge , and it acts over the length of the wedge . the output force pushes against the object on both sides of the wedge , so the output distance is the thickness of the wedge . therefore , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge can be calculated as : ideal mechanical advantage = length of wedge maximum thickness of wedge the length of a wedge is always greater than its maximum thickness . as a result , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge is always greater than 1 .

( this explanation could not account for the fact that fossils were not only found on mountains , but also within mountains , in rocks that had been qu ##ar ##ried from deep below earth ##s surface . ) the fossils formed within the rocks as a result of mysterious forces . but for ste ##no , the close resemblance between fossils and modern organisms was impossible to ignore . instead of in ##voking supernatural forces , ste ##no concluded that fossils were once parts of living creatures .

S-266	the wheels efficiency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user ( input work ) that becomes work done by the machine ( output work ) . the output work is always less than the input work because some of the input work is used to overcome friction . therefore , efficiency is always less than 100 percent . the closer to 100 percent a machines efficiency is , the better it is at reducing friction . look at the ramp in the figure 1 . 1 . a ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane . it is easier to push the heavy piece of furniture up the ramp to the truck than to lift it straight up off the ground , but pushing the furniture over the surface of the ramp creates a lot of friction . some of the force applied to moving the furniture must be used to overcome the friction with the ramp . q : why would it be more efficient to use a dolly to roll the furniture up the ramp ? a : there would be less friction to overcome if you used a dolly because of the wheels . so the efficiency of the ramp would be greater with the dolly .

S-215	the knife makes the job a lot easier imagine trying to slice a tomato with a fork or spoon instead of a knife , like the one in figure 16 . 15 . the knife makes the job a lot easier because of the wedge shape of the blade . a wedge is a simple machine that consists of two inclined planes . but unlike one inclined plane , a wedge works only when it moves . it has a thin end and thick end , and the thin end is forced into an object to cut or split it . the chi ##sel in figure 16 . 15 is another example of a wedge . the input force is applied to the thick end of a wedge , and it acts over the length of the wedge . the output force pushes against the object on both sides of the wedge , so the output distance is the thickness of the wedge . therefore , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge can be calculated as : ideal mechanical advantage = length of wedge maximum thickness of wedge the length of a wedge is always greater than its maximum thickness . as a result , the ideal mechanical advantage of a wedge is always greater than 1 .

S-29	neptune ##s appearance changes like ur ##anus , neptune is blue . the blue color is caused by gases in its atmosphere , including methane . neptune is not a smooth looking ball like ur ##anus . the planet has a few darker and lighter spots . when voyager 2 visited neptune in 1986 , there was a large dark - blue spot south of the equator . this spot was called the great dark spot . when the hub ##ble space telescope photographed neptune in 1994 , the great dark spot had disappeared . another dark spot had appeared north of the equator . astronomers believe that both of these spots represent gaps in the methane clouds on neptune . neptune ##s appearance changes due to its turbulent atmosphere . winds are stronger than on any other planet in the solar system . wind speeds can reach 1 , 100 km / h ( 700 mph ) . this is close to the speed of sound ! the rapid winds surprised astronomers . this is because neptune receives little energy from the sun to power weather systems . it is not surprising that neptune is one of the cold ##est places in the solar system . temperatures at the top of the clouds are about 218 ##c ( 360 ##f ) .

S-255	the more massive bowling ball is also harder to move what if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the same distance above the ground ? the bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball , so the pull of gravity on it is greater . would it fall to the ground faster ? no , the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time . the reason ? the more massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass , so it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the soccer ball . this is true of all falling objects . they all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity , unless air resistance affects one object more than another . for example , a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling ac ##orn because of the leafs greater surface area . q : if a leaf and an ac ##orn were to fall to the ground in the absence of air ( that is , in a vacuum ) , how would this affect their acceleration due to gravity ? a : they would both accelerate at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time .

S-287	men ##del ##ee ##vs table of the elements is called a periodic table you can see how men ##del ##ee ##v organized the elements in the figure 1 . 2 . from left to right across each row , elements are arranged by increasing atomic mass . men ##del ##ee ##v discovered that if he placed eight elements in each row and then continued on to the next row , the columns of the table would contain elements with similar properties . he called the columns groups . they are sometimes called families , because elements within a group are similar but not identical to one another , like people in a family . men ##del ##ee ##vs table of the elements is called a periodic table because of its repeating pattern . anything that keeps repeating is referred to as periodic . other examples of things that are periodic include the monthly phases of the moon and the daily cycle of night and day . the term period refers to the interval between repetition ##s . for example , the moons phases repeat every four weeks . in a periodic table of the elements , the periods are the rows of the table . in men ##del ##ee ##vs table , each period contains eight elements , and then the pattern repeats in the next row .

S-267	a : there would be less friction to overcome if you used a dolly efficiency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user ( input work ) that becomes work done by the machine ( output work ) . the output work is always less than the input work because some of the input work is used to overcome friction . therefore , efficiency is always less than 100 percent . the closer to 100 percent a machines efficiency is , the better it is at reducing friction . look at the ramp in the figure 1 . 1 . a ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane . it is easier to push the heavy piece of furniture up the ramp to the truck than to lift it straight up off the ground , but pushing the furniture over the surface of the ramp creates a lot of friction . some of the force applied to moving the furniture must be used to overcome the friction with the ramp . q : why would it be more efficient to use a dolly to roll the furniture up the ramp ? a : there would be less friction to overcome if you used a dolly because of the wheels . so the efficiency of the ramp would be greater with the dolly .

S-269	according to einstein , objects move toward one another einstein derived his theory using mathematics . however , you can get a good grasp of it with the help of a simple visual analogy . imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a tram ##pol ##ine . the surface of the tram ##pol ##ine would curve downward instead of being flat . now imagine placing a lighter ball at the edge of the tram ##pol ##ine . what will happen ? it will roll down toward the bowling ball . this apparent attraction to the bowling ball occurs because the tram ##pol ##ine curves downward , not because the two balls are actually attracted to one another by an invisible force called gravity . einstein theo ##rized that the sun and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a way that is similar to the effect of the bowling ball on the tram ##pol ##ine . the more massive a body is , the more it causes space - time to curve . this idea is represented by the figure 1 . 1 . according to einstein , objects move toward one another because of the curves in space - time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction . einstein ##s theory is supported by evidence and widely accepted today , although newton ##s law is still used for many calculations .

S-239	however in radio broadcasts , sounds are encoded in radio waves that are sent out through the atmosphere from a radio tower . a receiver detect ##s the radio waves and changes them back to sounds . you ##ve probably listened to both am and fm radio stations . how sounds are encoded in radio waves differs between am and fm broadcasts . am stands for amplitude modulation . in am broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the amplitude of radio waves . am broadcasts use longer ##wave ##len ##gt ##h radio waves than fm broadcasts . because of their longer wavelengths , am radio waves reflect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called the ion ##osphere . you can see how this happens in figure 21 . 8 . this allows am radio waves to reach radio receivers that are very far away from the radio tower . fm stands for frequency modulation . in fm broadcasts , sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency of radio waves . frequency modulation allows fm waves to en ##code more information than does amplitude modulation , so fm broadcasts usually sound clearer than am broadcasts . however , because of their shorter wavelength , fm waves do not reflect off the ion ##osphere . instead , they pass right through it and out into space ( see figure 21 . 8 ) . as a result , fm waves cannot reach very distant receivers .

S-275	magnet ##ism is magnet ##ism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet . magnet ##ism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter . when electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom , it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet , with north and south poles and a magnetic field . in most materials , the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions , so overall the material is not magnetic . examples of non ##ma ##gne ##tic materials include wood , glass , plastic , paper , copper , and aluminum . these materials are not attracted to magnet ##s and cannot become magnet ##s . in other materials , there are regions where the north and south poles of atoms are all lined up in the same direction . these regions are called magnetic domains . generally , the magnetic domains point in different directions , so the material is still not magnetic . however , the material can be magnet ##ized ( made into a magnet ) by placing it in a magnetic field . when this happens , all the magnetic domains line up , and the material becomes a magnet . you can see this in the figure 1 . 1 . materials that can be mag ##ni ##tized are called fe ##rro ##ma ##gne ##tic materials . they include iron , cobalt , and nickel .

S-268	the curves in space - time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction einstein derived his theory using mathematics . however , you can get a good grasp of it with the help of a simple visual analogy . imagine a bowling ball pressing down on a tram ##pol ##ine . the surface of the tram ##pol ##ine would curve downward instead of being flat . now imagine placing a lighter ball at the edge of the tram ##pol ##ine . what will happen ? it will roll down toward the bowling ball . this apparent attraction to the bowling ball occurs because the tram ##pol ##ine curves downward , not because the two balls are actually attracted to one another by an invisible force called gravity . einstein theo ##rized that the sun and other very massive bodies affect space and time around them in a way that is similar to the effect of the bowling ball on the tram ##pol ##ine . the more massive a body is , the more it causes space - time to curve . this idea is represented by the figure 1 . 1 . according to einstein , objects move toward one another because of the curves in space - time , not because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction . einstein ##s theory is supported by evidence and widely accepted today , although newton ##s law is still used for many calculations .

S-224	friction of the turning blades and other moving parts energy often changes from one form to another . for example , the mechanical energy of a moving drums ##tick changes to sound energy when it strikes the drum ##head and causes it to vi ##brate . any form of energy can change into any other form . frequently , one form of energy changes into two or more different forms . for example , when wood burns , the woods chemical energy changes to both thermal energy and light energy . other examples of energy conversions are described in figure 17 . 16 . you can see still others at this ur ##l : http : / / fi . ed ##u / guide / hughes / energy ##chang ##ee ##x . html . you can check your understanding of how energy changes form by doing the quiz ##zes at these ur ##ls : energy is conserved in energy conversions . no energy is lost when energy changes form , although some may be released as thermal energy due to friction . for example , not all of the energy put into a steam turbine in figure 17 . 16 changes to electrical energy . some changes to thermal energy because of friction of the turning blades and other moving parts . the more efficient a device is , the greater the percentage of usable energy it produces . appliances with an " energy star " label like the one in figure 17 . 17 use energy efficiently and thereby reduce energy use .

S-263	in this case , we see the material an opaque object is one that doesn ##t let light pass through it . instead , it reflects or absorb ##s the light that strikes it . many objects , such as the leaves pictured in the figure 1 . 3 , reflect just one or a few wavelengths of visible light and absorb the rest . the wavelengths that are reflected determine the color that an object appears to the human eye . for example , the leaves appear green because they reflect green light and absorb light of other wavelengths . a transparent or translucent material , such as window glass , transmit ##s some or all of the light that strikes it . this means that the light passes through the material rather than being reflected by it . in this case , we see the material because of the transmitted light . therefore , the wavelength of the transmitted light determines the color that the object appears . look at the beautiful stained glass windows in the figure 1 . 4 . the different colors of glass transmit the color of light that strikes an object may also affect the color that the object appears . for example , if only blue light strikes green leaves , the blue light is absorbed and no light is reflected . q : what color do you see if an object absorb ##s all of the light that strikes it ? a : when all of the light is absorbed , none is reflected , so the object looks black . but black isn ##t a color of light . black is the absence of light .

S-19	why don ##t they crash into earth why do satellites stay in orbit ? why don ##t they crash into earth due to the planets gravity ? newton ##s law of universal gr ##avi ##tation describes what happens . every object in the universe is attracted to every other object . gravity makes an apple fall to the ground . gravity also keeps you from floating away into the sky . gravity holds the moon in orbit around earth . it keeps earth in orbit around the sun . newton used an example to explain how gravity makes orbiting possible . imagine a cannon ##ball launched from a high mountain , as shown in figure 23 . 17 . if the cannon ##ball is launched at a slow speed , it will fall back to earth . this is shown as paths ( a ) and ( b ) . something different happens if the cannon ##ball is launched at a fast speed . the earth below curves away at the same rate that the cannon ##ball falls . the cannon ##ball then goes into a circular orbit , as in path ( c ) . if the cannon ##ball is launched even faster , it could go into an elliptical orbit ( d ) . it might even leave earth ##s gravity and go into space ( e ) . unfortunately , newton ##s idea would not work in real life . a cannon ##ball launched at a fast speed from mt . everest would not go into orbit . the cannon ##ball would burn up in the atmosphere . however , a rocket can launch straight up , then steer into orbit . it won ##t burn up in the orbit . a rocket can carry a satellite above the atmosphere and then release the satellite into orbit .

S-164	competition for water a population is a group of organisms of the same species , all living in the same area and interacting with each other . since they live together in one area , members of the same species reproduce together . eco ##logists who study populations determine how healthy or stable the populations are . they also study how the individuals of a species interact with each other and how populations interact with the environment . if a group of similar organisms in the same area cannot reproduce with members of the other group , then they are members of two distinct species and form two populations . eco ##logists look at many factors that help to describe a population . first , eco ##logists can measure the number of individuals that make up the population , known as population size . they can then determine the population density , which is the number of individuals of the same species in an area . population density can be expressed as number per area , such as 20 mice / acre , or 50 rabbits / square mile . eco ##logists also study how individuals in a population are spread across an environment . this spa ##cing of individuals within a population is called di ##sper ##sion . some species may be cl ##ump ##ed or clustered ( figure 1 . 1 ) in an area . others may be evenly spaced ( figure 1 . 2 ) . still others may be spaced randomly within an area . the population density and di ##sper ##sion have an effect on reproduction and population size . what do you think the relationship is between population density , di ##sper ##sion and size ? cl ##ump ##ed species are closer together . this may allow for easier reproduction . a population of ca ##ct ##i in the sonora ##n desert generally shows even di ##sper ##sion due to competition for water . eco ##logists also study the birth and death rates of the population . together these give the growth rate ( the birth rate minus the death rate ) , which tells how fast ( or slow ) the population size is changing . the birth rate is the number of births within a population during a specific time period . the death rate is the number of deaths within a population during a specific time period . knowing the birth and death rates of populations gives you information about a populations health . for example , when a population is made up of mostly young organisms and the birth rate is high , the population is growing . a population with equal birth and death rates will remain the same size . populations that are decreasing in size have a higher death rate than birth rate .

S-165	a population of ca ##ct ##i in the sonora ##n desert generally shows even di ##sper ##sion a population is a group of organisms of the same species , all living in the same area and interacting with each other . since they live together in one area , members of the same species reproduce together . eco ##logists who study populations determine how healthy or stable the populations are . they also study how the individuals of a species interact with each other and how populations interact with the environment . if a group of similar organisms in the same area cannot reproduce with members of the other group , then they are members of two distinct species and form two populations . eco ##logists look at many factors that help to describe a population . first , eco ##logists can measure the number of individuals that make up the population , known as population size . they can then determine the population density , which is the number of individuals of the same species in an area . population density can be expressed as number per area , such as 20 mice / acre , or 50 rabbits / square mile . eco ##logists also study how individuals in a population are spread across an environment . this spa ##cing of individuals within a population is called di ##sper ##sion . some species may be cl ##ump ##ed or clustered ( figure 1 . 1 ) in an area . others may be evenly spaced ( figure 1 . 2 ) . still others may be spaced randomly within an area . the population density and di ##sper ##sion have an effect on reproduction and population size . what do you think the relationship is between population density , di ##sper ##sion and size ? cl ##ump ##ed species are closer together . this may allow for easier reproduction . a population of ca ##ct ##i in the sonora ##n desert generally shows even di ##sper ##sion due to competition for water . eco ##logists also study the birth and death rates of the population . together these give the growth rate ( the birth rate minus the death rate ) , which tells how fast ( or slow ) the population size is changing . the birth rate is the number of births within a population during a specific time period . the death rate is the number of deaths within a population during a specific time period . knowing the birth and death rates of populations gives you information about a populations health . for example , when a population is made up of mostly young organisms and the birth rate is high , the population is growing . a population with equal birth and death rates will remain the same size . populations that are decreasing in size have a higher death rate than birth rate .

S-157	food moves through the es ##op ##ha ##gus the mouth is the first organ that food enters . but digest ##ion may start even before you put the first bite of food into your mouth . just seeing or smelling food can cause the release of saliva and digest ##ive enzymes in your mouth . this diagram shows how muscles push food through the digest ##ive system . muscle contraction ##s travel through the system in waves , pushing the food ahead of them . this is called per ##ista ##ls ##is . once you start eating , saliva wet ##s the food , which makes it easier to break up and swallow . digest ##ive enzymes , including the enzyme amy ##lase , start breaking down star ##ches into sugar ##s . your tongue helps mix the food with the saliva and enzymes . your teeth also help digest food . your front teeth are sharp . they cut and tear food when you bite into it . your back teeth are broad and flat . they grind food into smaller pieces when you chew . chewing is part of mechanical digest ##ion . your tongue pushes the food to the back of your mouth so you can swallow it . when you swallow , the lump of chewed food passes down your throat to your es ##op ##ha ##gus . the es ##op ##ha ##gus is a narrow tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach . food moves through the es ##op ##ha ##gus because of per ##ista ##ls ##is . at the lower end of the es ##op ##ha ##gus , a circular muscle controls the opening to the stomach . the muscle relax ##es to let food pass into the stomach . then the muscle contracts again to prevent food from passing back into the es ##op ##ha ##gus . some people think that gravity moves food through the es ##op ##ha ##gus . if that were true , food would move through the es ##op ##ha ##gus only when you are sitting or standing upright . in fact , because of per ##ista ##ls ##is , food can move through the es ##op ##ha ##gus no matter what position you are in ##eve ##n upside down ! just don ##t try to swallow food when you are upside down ##you could choke ! the stomach is a sac - like organ at the end of the es ##op ##ha ##gus . it has thick muscular walls . the muscles contract and relax . this moves the food around and helps break it into smaller pieces . mixing the food around with the enzyme pepsi ##n and other chemicals helps digest proteins . water , salt , and simple sugar ##s can be absorbed into the blood from the stomach . most other substances are broken down further in the small int ##est ##ine before they are absorbed . the stomach stores food until the small int ##est ##ine is ready to receive

S-188	genes on the x chromosome what determines if a baby is a male or female ? recall that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes ##and one of those pairs is the sex chromosomes . everyone has two sex chromosomes . your sex chromosomes can be x or y . females have two x chromosomes ( xx ) , while males have one x chromosome and one y chromosome ( x ##y ) . if a baby inherit ##s an x chromosome from the father and an x chromosome from the mother , what will be the child ##s sex ? the baby will have two x chromosomes , so it will be female . if the fathers sperm carries the y chromosome , the child will be male . notice that a mother can only pass on an x chromosome , so the sex of the baby is determined by the father . the father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the y or x chromosome , so there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be male , and there is a 50 percent chance a child will be female . this 50 : 50 chance occurs for each baby . a couples first five children could all be boys . the sixth child still has a 50 : 50 chance of being a girl . one special pattern of inheritance that doesn ##t fit men ##del ##s rules is sex - linked inheritance , referring to the in ##her - it ##ance of traits that are located on genes on the sex chromosomes . since males and females do not have the same sex chromosomes , there will be differences between the sexes in how these sex - linked traits ##tra ##its linked to genes located on the sex chromosomes ##are expressed . sex - linked traits usually refer to traits due to genes on the x chromosome . one example of a sex - linked trait is red - green color ##bl ##ind ##ness . people with this type of color ##bl ##ind ##ness cannot tell the difference between red and green . they often see these colors as shades of brown ( figure 1 . 1 ) . boys are much more likely to be color ##bl ##ind than girls ( table 1 . 1 ) . this is because color ##bl ##ind ##ness is a sex - linked , recess ##ive trait . boys only have one x chromosome , so if that chromosome carries the gene for color ##bl ##ind ##ness , they will be color ##bl ##ind . as girls have two x chromosomes , a girl can have one x chromosome with the color ##bl ##ind gene and one x chromosome with a normal gene for color vision . since color ##bl ##ind ##ness is recess ##ive , the dominant normal gene will mask the recess ##ive color ##bl ##ind gene . females with one color ##bl ##ind ##ness all ##ele and one normal all ##ele are referred

S-102	their very small size the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram ( often referred to as the h - r diagram ) is a sc ##atter graph that shows various classes of stars in the context of properties such as their lu ##min ##osity , absolute magnitude , color , and effective temperature . created around 1910 by e ##jn ##ar her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g and henry norris russell , the diagram provided a great help in understanding stellar evolution . there are several forms of the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram , and the nomenclature is not very well defined . the original diagram displayed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the absolute magnitude on the vertical axis . the form below shows kelvin temperature along the horizontal axis going from high temperature on the left to low temperature on the right and lu ##min ##osity on the vertical axis . we can think of the lu ##min ##osity as brightness in multiple ##s of the sun . a lu ##min ##osity of 100 on the axis would mean 100 times as bright as the sun . most of the stars occupy a region in the diagram along a line called the main sequence . during that stage , stars are fu ##sing hydrogen into helium in their cores . the position of the sun in the main sequence is shown in the diagram . you should note that the axial scales for this diagram are not linear . the vertical scale is log ##ari ##th ##mic , each line is 100 times greater than the previous line . on the horizontal axis , as we move to the right , the temperature reduces by between 1 , 000 and 10 , 000 degrees k between each line . if all other factors were the same , the highest temperature stars would also be the most luminous ( the brightest ) . in the main sequence of stars , we see that as the temperature increases to the left , the lu ##min ##osity also increases , demonstrating that the hottest stars in this grouping are also the brightest . there are stars , however , that are less bright than their temperature would predict . this group of stars is called white dwarfs . these stars are less bright than expected because of their very small size . these dwarf stars are only one one - thousand ##th the size of stars in the main sequence . there are also stars that are much brighter than their temperature would predict . this group of stars are called red giants . they are brighter than their temperature would predict because they are much larger than stars in the main sequence . these stars have expanded to several thousand times the size of stars in the main sequence . stars that are reddish in color are cooler than other stars while stars that are blu ##ish in color are hotter

S-189	sex - linked traits usually refer to traits what determines if a baby is a male or female ? recall that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes ##and one of those pairs is the sex chromosomes . everyone has two sex chromosomes . your sex chromosomes can be x or y . females have two x chromosomes ( xx ) , while males have one x chromosome and one y chromosome ( x ##y ) . if a baby inherit ##s an x chromosome from the father and an x chromosome from the mother , what will be the child ##s sex ? the baby will have two x chromosomes , so it will be female . if the fathers sperm carries the y chromosome , the child will be male . notice that a mother can only pass on an x chromosome , so the sex of the baby is determined by the father . the father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the y or x chromosome , so there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be male , and there is a 50 percent chance a child will be female . this 50 : 50 chance occurs for each baby . a couples first five children could all be boys . the sixth child still has a 50 : 50 chance of being a girl . one special pattern of inheritance that doesn ##t fit men ##del ##s rules is sex - linked inheritance , referring to the in ##her - it ##ance of traits that are located on genes on the sex chromosomes . since males and females do not have the same sex chromosomes , there will be differences between the sexes in how these sex - linked traits ##tra ##its linked to genes located on the sex chromosomes ##are expressed . sex - linked traits usually refer to traits due to genes on the x chromosome . one example of a sex - linked trait is red - green color ##bl ##ind ##ness . people with this type of color ##bl ##ind ##ness cannot tell the difference between red and green . they often see these colors as shades of brown ( figure 1 . 1 ) . boys are much more likely to be color ##bl ##ind than girls ( table 1 . 1 ) . this is because color ##bl ##ind ##ness is a sex - linked , recess ##ive trait . boys only have one x chromosome , so if that chromosome carries the gene for color ##bl ##ind ##ness , they will be color ##bl ##ind . as girls have two x chromosomes , a girl can have one x chromosome with the color ##bl ##ind gene and one x chromosome with a normal gene for color vision . since color ##bl ##ind ##ness is recess ##ive , the dominant normal gene will mask the recess ##ive color ##bl ##ind gene . females with one color ##bl ##ind ##ness all ##ele and one normal all

S-103	these stars are less bright than expected the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram ( often referred to as the h - r diagram ) is a sc ##atter graph that shows various classes of stars in the context of properties such as their lu ##min ##osity , absolute magnitude , color , and effective temperature . created around 1910 by e ##jn ##ar her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g and henry norris russell , the diagram provided a great help in understanding stellar evolution . there are several forms of the her ##tz ##sp ##run ##g - russell diagram , and the nomenclature is not very well defined . the original diagram displayed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the absolute magnitude on the vertical axis . the form below shows kelvin temperature along the horizontal axis going from high temperature on the left to low temperature on the right and lu ##min ##osity on the vertical axis . we can think of the lu ##min ##osity as brightness in multiple ##s of the sun . a lu ##min ##osity of 100 on the axis would mean 100 times as bright as the sun . most of the stars occupy a region in the diagram along a line called the main sequence . during that stage , stars are fu ##sing hydrogen into helium in their cores . the position of the sun in the main sequence is shown in the diagram . you should note that the axial scales for this diagram are not linear . the vertical scale is log ##ari ##th ##mic , each line is 100 times greater than the previous line . on the horizontal axis , as we move to the right , the temperature reduces by between 1 , 000 and 10 , 000 degrees k between each line . if all other factors were the same , the highest temperature stars would also be the most luminous ( the brightest ) . in the main sequence of stars , we see that as the temperature increases to the left , the lu ##min ##osity also increases , demonstrating that the hottest stars in this grouping are also the brightest . there are stars , however , that are less bright than their temperature would predict . this group of stars is called white dwarfs . these stars are less bright than expected because of their very small size . these dwarf stars are only one one - thousand ##th the size of stars in the main sequence . there are also stars that are much brighter than their temperature would predict . this group of stars are called red giants . they are brighter than their temperature would predict because they are much larger than stars in the main sequence . these stars have expanded to several thousand times the size of stars in the main sequence . stars that are reddish in color are cooler than other stars while stars that are blu ##ish in
